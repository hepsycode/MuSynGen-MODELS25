This metamodel is designed to support the description of various components, their interactions, and the flow of messages within a system. The domain scope is likely to be system engineering, encompassing both hardware and software elements, with a particular emphasis on communication channels, processes, and message structures.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Classes\n\n1. **BehaviorSpecification**\n   - **Supertype**: NamedElement\n   - **Attributes**: None\n   - **References**:\n     - `nodes` (0..*) references to `Node`, containment=true\n   - **Description**: Represents the specification of the system's overall behavior, containing various nodes.\n\n2. **Node** (Abstract)\n   - **Supertype**: NamedElement\n   - **Attributes**: None\n   - **References**:\n     - `nChannels` (0..*) references to `Channel`, containment=true\n     - `ports` (0..*) references to `Port`, containment=true\n   - **Description**: An abstract class representing a node in the system, which can contain channels and ports.\n\n3. **Channel**\n   - **Supertype**: NamedElement\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `queueSize`: EInt\n     - `timeout`: EInt\n     - `rendezVous`: EBoolean\n     - `direction`: EString\n   - **References**:\n     - `nFrom` (0..1) references to `Node`\n     - `nTo` (0..1) references to `Node`\n     - `pFrom` (0..1) references to `Port`\n     - `pTo` (0..1) references to `Port`\n     - `message` (0..1) references to `Message`, containment=true\n   - **Description**: Represents a communication channel between nodes and ports, with attributes describing its properties.\n\n4. **NamedElement**\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `name`: EString\n   - **Description**: A base class providing a name attribute to its subclasses.\n\n5. **StructuredNode**\n   - **Supertype**: Node\n   - **References**:\n     - `processes` (0..*) references to `Process`, containment=true\n   - **Description**: A concrete subclass of Node that can contain multiple processes.\n\n6. **Port**\n   - **Supertype**: NamedElement\n   - **References**:\n     - `pChannels` (0..*) references to `Channel`, containment=true\n     - `portExtension` (0..1) references to `Process`\n   - **Description**: Represents a port that can be connected to multiple channels and associated with a process.\n\n7. **Process**\n   - **Supertype**: Node\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `priority`: EInt, default=1\n     - `criticality`: EInt\n   - **References**:\n     - `processExtension` (0..1) references to `Port`\n   - **Description**: Represents a process within a system, including attributes for priority and criticality.\n\n8. **Display / Stimulus**\n   - **Supertype**: Node\n   - **Description**: Specific types of nodes that do not add additional attributes or references. `Display` and `Stimulus` likely represent specialized nodes within the system.\n\n9. **Message**\n   - **Supertype**: NamedElement\n   - **References**:\n     - `entry` (0..*) references to `Entry`, containment=true\n   - **Description**: Represents a message that can contain multiple entries.\n\n10. **Entry**\n    - **Supertype**: NamedElement\n    - **Attributes**:\n      - `type`: EString (mandatory)\n    - **Description**: Represents an entry within a message, with an attribute describing its type.\n\n### Enumerations\n\n1. **DataType**\n   - **Literals**: sc_bit, sc_logic, sc_int, sc_uint, sc_bigint, sc_biguint, sc_bv, sc_lv, sc_fixed, sc_ufixed, sc_fix, sc_ufix\n   - **Description**: Enumerates various data types that can be used within the system, likely for specifying the type of message entries.\n\n2. **Direction**\n   - **Literals**: Unidirectional, Bidirectional\n   - **Description**: Enumerates the possible directions for communication channels.\n\n## Relationships\n\n1. **Containment Hierarchies**:\n   - `BehaviorSpecification` contains multiple `Node` elements.\n   - `Node` contains multiple `Channel` and `Port` elements.\n   - `StructuredNode` contains multiple `Process` elements.\n   - `Channel` contains a `Message`.\n   - `Message` contains multiple `Entry` elements.\n\n2. **Associations**:\n   - `Channel` can be associated with `Node` elements via `nFrom` and `nTo` references.\n   - `Channel` can be associated with `Port` elements via `pFrom` and `pTo` references.\n   - `Port` can be associated with multiple `Channel` elements via `pChannels`.\n   - `Port` can extend a `Process` via `portExtension`.\n   - `Process` can extend a `Port` via `processExtension`.\n\n3. **Multiplicities**:\n   - Most references allow for multiple elements (0..*), indicating flexible and scalable system structures.\n   - Some references are optional (0..1), allowing for optional extensions and associations.\n\n## Behavioral Semantics\n\nThe metamodel implies a system where nodes communicate through channels, and these channels can have properties like queue size, timeout, and rendezvous behavior. The direction of communication (unidirectional or bidirectional) is also specified. Processes within structured nodes can have priorities and criticality levels, indicating a hierarchical and prioritized execution model.\n\nMessages sent through channels can contain multiple entries, each with a specified type. The enumeration `DataType` suggests that the system supports a wide range of data types, likely applicable to the entries within messages.\n\n## External Domain Background\n\nThe domain represented by this metamodel is closely related to hardware and software system engineering, particularly in the context of embedded systems, real-time systems, and communication protocols. Key concepts and terminology from this domain include:\n\n- **Nodes**: Represent components or modules within a system.\n- **Channels**: Communication paths between nodes, analogous to buses or communication links in hardware systems.\n- **Ports**: Interfaces for communication, similar to hardware ports or software interfaces.\n- **Processes**: Execution units within a system, akin to tasks or threads in software systems.\n- **Messages**: Data packets exchanged between components, similar to messages in communication protocols.\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\n1. **Embedded Systems**: The metamodel can be used to specify the behavior of embedded systems, where nodes represent hardware components, and channels represent communication buses.\n2. **Real-Time Systems**: The priority and criticality attributes in processes suggest applicability in real-time systems, where timing and reliability are crucial.\n3. **Communication Protocols**: The detailed specification of channels and messages makes the metamodel suitable for defining communication protocols in distributed systems.\n\n### Relevant Standards and Protocols\n\n- **SystemC**: The enumeration `DataType` with literals like `sc_bit` and `sc_logic` suggests a relationship with SystemC, a language for modeling hardware and software systems.\n- **CAN Bus**: The concept of channels with properties like queue size and timeout is reminiscent of the CAN bus protocol used in automotive and industrial automation.\n\nBy integrating this structured domain context, a synthetic model generation tool can effectively guide the creation of complex system models, ensuring adherence to the specified metamodel and leveraging relevant domain knowledge."
