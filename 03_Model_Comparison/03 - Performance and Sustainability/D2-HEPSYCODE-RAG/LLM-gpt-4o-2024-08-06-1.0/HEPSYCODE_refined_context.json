This metamodel is designed to capture the interactions and communications between different components within a system, making it suitable for domains such as hardware modeling, system behavior, and message passing. The metamodel is part of the \"hepsy\" package with the namespace URI \"org.univaq.hepsy\".\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Classes\n\n1. **BehaviorSpecification**\n   - **Superclass:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `nodes` (Type: Node, Multiplicity: 0..*, Containment: true)\n\n2. **Node** (Abstract)\n   - **Superclass:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `nChannels` (Type: Channel, Multiplicity: 0..*, Containment: true)\n     - `ports` (Type: Port, Multiplicity: 0..*, Containment: true)\n\n3. **Channel**\n   - **Superclass:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `queueSize` (Type: EInt)\n     - `timeout` (Type: EInt)\n     - `rendezVous` (Type: EBoolean)\n     - `direction` (Type: EString)\n   - **References:**\n     - `nFrom` (Type: Node, Multiplicity: 0..1)\n     - `nTo` (Type: Node, Multiplicity: 0..1)\n     - `pFrom` (Type: Port, Multiplicity: 0..1)\n     - `pTo` (Type: Port, Multiplicity: 0..1)\n     - `message` (Type: Message, Containment: true)\n\n4. **NamedElement**\n   - **Superclass:** None\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `name` (Type: EString)\n   - **References:** None\n\n5. **StructuredNode**\n   - **Superclass:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `processes` (Type: Process, Multiplicity: 0..*, Containment: true)\n\n6. **Port**\n   - **Superclass:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `pChannels` (Type: Channel, Multiplicity: 0..*, Containment: true)\n     - `portExtension` (Type: Process)\n\n7. **Process**\n   - **Superclass:** Node\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `priority` (Type: EInt, Default: 1)\n     - `criticality` (Type: EInt)\n   - **References:**\n     - `processExtension` (Type: Port)\n\n8. **Display**\n   - **Superclass:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:** None\n\n9. **Stimulus**\n   - **Superclass:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:** None\n\n10. **Message**\n    - **Superclass:** NamedElement\n    - **Attributes:** None\n    - **References:**\n      - `entry` (Type: Entry, Multiplicity: 0..*, Containment: true)\n\n11. **Entry**\n    - **Superclass:** NamedElement\n    - **Attributes:**\n      - `type` (Type: EString, Multiplicity: 1)\n    - **References:** None\n\n### Enumerations\n\n1. **DataType**\n   - **Literals:**\n     - `sc_bit`\n     - `sc_logic`\n     - `sc_int`\n     - `sc_uint`\n     - `sc_bigint`\n     - `sc_biguint`\n     - `sc_bv`\n     - `sc_lv`\n     - `sc_fixed`\n     - `sc_ufixed`\n     - `sc_fix`\n     - `sc_ufix`\n\n2. **Direction**\n   - **Literals:**\n     - `Unidirectional`\n     - `Bidirectional`\n\n## Relationships\n\n1. **Containment Relationships:**\n   - `BehaviorSpecification` contains `Node`.\n   - `Node` contains `Channel` and `Port`.\n   - `Channel` contains `Message`.\n   - `StructuredNode` contains `Process`.\n   - `Port` contains `Channel`.\n   - `Message` contains `Entry`.\n\n2. **Association Relationships:**\n   - `Channel` is associated with `Node` (via `nFrom` and `nTo`).\n   - `Channel` is associated with `Port` (via `pFrom` and `pTo`).\n   - `Port` is associated with `Process` (via `portExtension`).\n   - `Process` is associated with `Port` (via `processExtension`).\n\n3. **Inheritance Relationships:**\n   - `Node` is a superclass for `StructuredNode`, `Process`, `Display`, and `Stimulus`.\n   - `NamedElement` is a superclass for `BehaviorSpecification`, `Node`, `Channel`, `Port`, and `Message`.\n\n## Behavioral Semantics\n\nThe metamodel implies a system where nodes interact through channels and ports. Channels can have attributes like `queueSize`, `timeout`, `rendezVous`, and `direction`, which suggest that they are used for message passing with specific constraints. The `Message` class and its contained `Entry` class indicate that messages have structured data entries. The `Process` class, with attributes like `priority` and `criticality`, suggests that processes have different levels of importance and urgency.\n\n## External Domain Background\n\n### Hardware Modeling\n\nIn hardware modeling, nodes can represent different components or modules within a system, while channels represent the communication paths between these components. The attributes of channels, such as `queueSize` and `timeout`, are crucial for modeling the behavior of communication links in hardware systems.\n\n### System Behavior\n\nIn system behavior modeling, nodes can represent different system components or subsystems, while channels model the communication between these components. The `Process` class, with its `priority` and `criticality` attributes, is essential for modeling the behavior of processes within a system, especially in real-time systems where prioritization and criticality are important.\n\n### Message Passing\n\nIn message passing systems, nodes can represent different entities that communicate through messages. Channels model the communication links, and the `Message` class, along with its `Entry` class, represents the structured data being communicated. The `Direction` enumeration (`Unidirectional` and `Bidirectional`) is crucial for defining the direction of message flow.\n\n### Relevant Terminology\n\n- **Node:** A component or module within a system.\n- **Channel:** A communication path between nodes.\n- **Port:** An interface for communication between nodes and channels.\n- **Process:** A task or operation within a system, often with specific priority and criticality.\n- **Message:** Structured data communicated between nodes.\n- **Entry:** A data element within a message.\n- **QueueSize:** The capacity of a channel's queue.\n- **Timeout:** The maximum time a channel can wait for a message.\n- **RendezVous:** A synchronization mechanism for message passing.\n- **Direction:** The flow of messages (unidirectional or bidirectional).\n\n## Tool Name\n\nBased on the package name \"hepsy,\" the tool can be named \"Hepsy Modeling Tool.\"\n\nThis structured context provides a comprehensive background for generating synthetic models based on the Hepsy metamodel, enriched with relevant domain knowledge and terminology."
