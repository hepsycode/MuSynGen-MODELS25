This metamodel is designed to capture the interactions and communications between different components within a system, making it suitable for domains such as hardware modeling, system behavior simulation, and message passing in distributed systems. The metamodel is part of the \"hepsy\" package with the namespace URI \"org.univaq.hepsy\".\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Classes\n\n1. **BehaviorSpecification**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   -

`BehaviorSpecification` contains multiple `Node` instances.\n  - `Node` contains multiple `Channel` and `Port` instances.\n  - `StructuredNode` contains multiple `Process` instances.\n  - `Channel` contains a `Message` instance.\n  - `Message` contains multiple `Entry` instances.\n  - `Port` contains multiple `Channel` instances.\n\n- **Association Relationships:**\n  - `Channel` is associated with `Node` through `nFrom` and `nTo`.\n  - `Channel` is associated with `Port` through `pFrom` and `pTo`.\n  - `Port` is associated with `Process` through `portExtension`.\n  - `Process` is associated with `Port` through `processExtension`.\n\n## Behavioral Semantics\n\nThe behavioral semantics of the Hepsy metamodel can be inferred from the structure and relationships defined:\n\n- **BehaviorSpecification** acts as a container for various nodes, which can be of different types such as `StructuredNode`, `Display`, `Stimulus`, and `Process`.\n- **Nodes** can have multiple channels and ports, facilitating communication and data exchange.\n- **Channels** define the communication pathways between nodes and ports, with attributes like `queueSize`, `timeout`, `rendezVous`, and `direction` influencing the communication behavior.\n- **Ports** act as interfaces for nodes, allowing them to connect to channels and extend processes.\n- **Processes** represent computational units with attributes like `priority` and `criticality`, indicating their importance and urgency.\n- **Messages** are contained within channels and consist of multiple entries, each with a specific type.\n\n## External Domain Background\n\nThe Hepsy metamodel is well-suited for domains involving complex system behaviors, such as:\n\n- **Hardware Modeling:** The concepts of nodes, channels, ports, and processes are analogous to hardware components, communication buses, interfaces, and processing units.\n- **System Behavior Simulation:** The metamodel can be used to simulate the behavior of systems, including the interaction between different components and the flow of messages.\n- **Message Passing in Distributed Systems:** The structure supports the modeling of message passing between distributed components, with channels representing communication links and messages containing the data being transmitted.\n\n### Relevant Terminology\n\n- **Node:** A fundamental unit in the system, representing a component or entity.\n- **Channel:** A communication pathway between nodes and ports.\n- **Port:** An interface for nodes, allowing them to connect to channels.\n- **Process:** A computational unit within a node, with attributes indicating its priority and criticality.\n- **Message:** A data structure contained within channels, consisting of multiple entries.\n- **Entry:** A component of a message, with a specific type.\n\n### Metadata\n\n- **Package Name:** hepsy\n- **Namespace URI:** org.univaq.hepsy\n- **Namespace Prefix:** hml\n\nThis structured domain context provides a comprehensive background for generating synthetic models based on the Hepsy metamodel, ensuring that the models align with the intended domain and behavioral semantics."
