    "context": "# BPMN Designer: A Sirius Eclipse-based Graphical Modeling Workbench for Business Process Model and Notation\n\n## Introduction\n\nBusiness Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a graphical representation used for specifying business processes in Business Process Modeling (BPM). Originally developed by the Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI), BPMN is now managed by the Object Management Group (OMG). The current version, BPMN 2.0.2, was published in January 2014 and is also recognized as an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 19510) since July 2013. BPMN provides a standardized notation for creating Business Process Diagrams (BPDs), which are based on flowchart techniques similar to UML activity diagrams. It aims to support business process management for both technical and business users by offering an intuitive yet semantically rich notation.\n\n## BPMN and UML\n\nBPMN and UML are complementary modeling specifications developed by the OMG. While UML focuses on the analysis and design of information systems, BPMN is dedicated to the analysis and design of business processes that involve and interact with these systems. This complementary nature allows for a seamless transition from BPMN process diagrams, which define business requirements, to UML diagrams, which document system requirements.\n\n## Key Features of BPMN\n\nBPMN is designed to be easily understandable by all business stakeholders, including business analysts, technical developers, and business managers. It supports the goal of having a common language for describing processes, thereby reducing communication gaps between the design and implementation of business processes. BPMN also provides a mapping between its graphical notation and the constructs of execution languages like the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL).\n\n## BPMN vs. Other Modeling Languages\n\nBPMN is one of several standard languages for business process modeling. While there is a variety of languages that cater to different modeling environments, there is a call for a unified standard that combines the strengths of existing languages. This unified standard could help in expressing both basic and advanced process concepts more effectively. BPMN is specifically tailored for business process modeling and does not cover other types of modeling such as organizational structures or data flow diagrams.\n\n## BPMN Elements\n\nBPMN models are composed of simple diagrams created from a limited set of graphical elements. These elements are categorized into four basic types: Flow Objects, Connecting Objects, Swimlanes, and Artifacts.\n\n### Flow Objects\n\nFlow Objects are the primary descriptive elements within BPMN and include Events, Activities, and Gateways.\n\n- **Events**: Represented by circles, events denote something that happens. They are classified into three levels: Start, Intermediate, and End.\n- **Activities**: Represented by rectangles with rounded corners, activities describe the work to be done. They can be atomistic (tasks) or composite (sub-processes).\n- **Gateways**: Represented by diamonds, gateways indicate a split or merge in the process flow based on conditions.\n\n### Connecting Objects\n\nConnecting Objects link the flow objects and include Sequence Flows, Message Flows, and Associations.\n\n### Swimlanes\n\nSwimlanes are a visual mechanism for organizing and categorizing activities based on pools and lanes.\n\n### Artifacts\n\nArtifacts provide additional information within the model to improve readability. BPMN includes predefined artifacts such as Data Objects, Groups, and Annotations.\n\n## BPMN Designer\n\nBPMN Designer is a set of plugins created with Eclipse/Sirius that provides a graphical modeling workbench for BPMN 2.0 models. It is released under the EPL Open-Source License and can be installed and tested using the following steps:\n\n1. **Download Obeo Designer Community Edition**: Version 11.9 from [Obeo Designer](https://www.obeodesigner.com/).\n2. **Unzip and Start**: Extract the downloaded file and launch the application.\n3. **Add BPMN Designer Update Site**: Use the update site link provided [here](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/obeo-bpmndesigner-releases/5.1.4/repository/).\n4. **Install Features**: Install the BPMN Designer and Sirius Support for Legacy Queries features.\n5. **Create a Sample Project**: To test, create a new sample project via `Ctrl+N > Examples > BPMN > BPMN Samples`.\n\n### Obeo Designer\n\nObeo Designer, developed by Obeo Network, guarantees the setup and deployment of industrial-strength modeling workbenches created with Sirius. It provides professional support and collaborative features, allowing teams to work simultaneously on visual representations of the same data without managing conflicts. Obeo Designer also offers subscription-based support and maintenance services for deploying Sirius on professional projects.\n\n## BPMN Model Interchange Test Suite\n\nThe BPMN Model Interchange Working Group (BPMN MIWG) at the OMG has created a test suite for BPMN 2.0 tools. This suite includes test cases, models, diagrams, and serializations to ensure the interoperability of BPMN models across different tools. The test suite is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-test-suite) and includes detailed procedures for importing, exporting, and roundtrip testing of BPMN models. The MIWG encourages users to test their favorite BPMN tools and submit the results to contribute to the improvement of BPMN interchange standards.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBPMN Designer, leveraging the Eclipse/Sirius platform, offers a robust solution for designing and managing BPMN 2.0 models. With its intuitive interface and comprehensive features, it supports both technical and business users in creating clear and effective business process diagrams. The integration with the BPMN MIWG test suite ensures that models created with BPMN Designer are standards-compliant and interoperable with other BPMN tools.\n\n## References\n\n- [Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation)\n- [BPMN Designer GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/BPMN-Designer)\n- [Obeo Designer](https://www.obeodesigner.com/en/)\n- [BPMN Model Interchange Test Suite](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-test-suite)"
