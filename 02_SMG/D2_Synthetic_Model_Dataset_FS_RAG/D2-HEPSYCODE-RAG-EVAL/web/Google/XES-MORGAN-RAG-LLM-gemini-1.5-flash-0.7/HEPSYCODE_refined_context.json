    "context": "## Refined Context: HEPSYCODE Tool\n\n**Source Metadata:**\n\n* **Package Name:** `HEPSYCODE`\n* **Namespace URI:** `org.univaq.hepsy`\n* **Source Documents:**  *(No specific documents provided; information derived solely from package name and namespace URI)*\n\n\n**Tool Name:** HEPSYCODE\n\n**Description:**  Based solely on the provided metamodel information (package name `HEPSYCODE` and namespace URI `org.univaq.hepsy`),  we can only infer the existence of a tool named \"HEPSYCODE\".  No further details regarding its functionality, purpose, or specific features can be derived from this minimal input.  Additional documentation or specifications are required to provide a more comprehensive context.  The namespace URI suggests an association with the University of L'Aquila (\"univaq\") and potentially a project or research group related to \"hepsy\" (the meaning of which is unknown without further context).\n\n\n**Limitations:** This context is extremely limited due to the scarcity of input data.  The description is purely inferential and lacks concrete details about the tool's capabilities.  To expand this context, further information is needed, such as:\n\n* **Tool documentation:** User manuals, API specifications, or any other descriptive materials.\n* **Source code:**  Analysis of the source code would reveal the tool's internal workings and functionality.\n* **Related publications:** Research papers or articles that mention the tool and its application.\n\n\nThis refined context provides a minimal description based solely on the given metamodel information, clearly highlighting the limitations resulting from the lack of additional details."
