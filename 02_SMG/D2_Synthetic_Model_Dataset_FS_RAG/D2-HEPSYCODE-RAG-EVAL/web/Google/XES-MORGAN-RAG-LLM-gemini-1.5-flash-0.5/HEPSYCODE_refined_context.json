    "context": "## Refined Context: Minimal Tool Name Derivation from Package Name\n\n**Query:** Derive a minimal tool name from the `HEPSYCODE` package name within the `org.univaq.hepsy` namespace URI.\n\n**Retrieved Documents & Metadata:**  (No documents were provided.  The following analysis assumes a standard approach to naming conventions based on common practices.)\n\n**Analysis & Synthesis:**\n\nThe question asks for a minimal tool name derived *solely* from the package name \"HEPSYCODE\".  This implies that we should avoid incorporating elements from the namespace URI (`org.univaq.hepsy`) or adding prefixes, suffixes, or other embellishments. A straightforward approach is to use the package name directly as the tool name.\n\nTherefore, the minimal tool name derived solely from the package name `HEPSYCODE` is:\n\n**HEPSYCODE**\n\n**Justification:**\n\nThis approach adheres strictly to the query's constraints.  More descriptive names could be generated by incorporating parts of the namespace URI (e.g., UnivaqHEPSYCode) or by adding clarifying suffixes (e.g., HEPSYCODE-Tool), but these would violate the requirement for a minimal name derived *solely* from the package name.\n\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n* **Naming Conventions:** While \"HEPSYCODE\" is a minimal and technically correct answer, it might not be the most user-friendly or descriptive tool name in a real-world application.  Best practices often recommend more descriptive names that clearly communicate the tool's purpose.\n* **Collision Avoidance:** In a larger software ecosystem, a simple name like \"HEPSYCODE\" might conflict with other tools or libraries.  A more comprehensive naming strategy would be necessary to mitigate this risk.\n* **Contextual Information:** The lack of provided documents limits the ability to consider context-specific naming conventions or requirements that might influence the choice of tool name.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased solely on the provided package name, the minimal tool name is **HEPSYCODE**. However, it's crucial to consider broader naming conventions and potential conflicts when choosing a tool name for practical applications.  A more robust naming strategy should be employed in a real-world scenario."
