    "context": "## Refined Context: HEPSYCODE Tool\n\n**Source Metadata:**\n\n* **Query:** Metamodel Analysis Query\n* **Package Name:** HEPSYCODE\n* **Namespace URI:** org.univaq.hepsy\n* **Classifiers:** None\n* **Retrieved Documents:** (None provided â€“  assuming this refers to a lack of supporting documentation beyond the metamodel information itself.  This limitation is explicitly addressed below.)\n\n**Generated Context:**\n\nBased solely on the provided metamodel information (Package Name: HEPSYCODE, Namespace URI: org.univaq.hepsy, Classifiers: None), the minimal context for a tool built upon this metamodel is as follows:\n\n**Tool Name:** HEPSYCODE Tool\n\n**Description:** The HEPSYCODE Tool is a software application designed to interact with a system whose structure is defined by the `org.univaq.hepsy` metamodel.  The absence of specified classifiers prevents further detail on the tool's specific functionality.  Without additional information about the metamodel's contents (e.g., classes, attributes, relationships), we can only conclude that the tool likely provides basic functionalities related to accessing, manipulating, or analyzing data conforming to this metamodel.  These functionalities could include, but are not limited to:\n\n* **Model Loading/Parsing:** The ability to load and parse models conforming to the `org.univaq.hepsy` namespace.\n* **Model Validation:**  Basic checks to ensure model instances comply with the constraints defined by the metamodel.\n* **Data Access:** Methods to access and retrieve data based on the model's structure.\n* **Model Transformation (Potential):**  Depending on the metamodel's complexity, the tool might offer functionality for transforming models from one format to another.\n\n\n**Limitations:**  This description is significantly limited by the lack of detailed metamodel information.  The absence of classifiers prevents a precise definition of the tool's specific features and capabilities.  To provide a more comprehensive context, additional information about the `org.univaq.hepsy` metamodel is required, including:\n\n* **Classifier Details:**  A list of classes, their attributes, and relationships defined within the metamodel.  This will clarify the data structures the tool interacts with.\n* **Model Constraints:**  Any rules or constraints imposed by the metamodel on valid instances.\n* **Functional Requirements:**  A description of the tool's intended purpose and functionalities beyond basic model interaction.\n\n\nWithout this supplementary information, the HEPSYCODE Tool description remains highly abstract and serves only as a basic framework based on the minimal information provided."
