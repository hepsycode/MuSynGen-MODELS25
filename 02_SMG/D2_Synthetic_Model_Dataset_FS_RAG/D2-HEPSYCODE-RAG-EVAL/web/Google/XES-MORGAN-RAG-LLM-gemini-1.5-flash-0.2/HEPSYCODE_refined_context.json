    "context": "## Refined Context: Minimal Tool Name Derivation from Package Name\n\n**Query:** Derive a minimal tool name from the `HEPSYCODE` package name within the `org.univaq.hepsy` namespace URI.\n\n**Retrieved Documents & Metadata:**  *(No documents were provided.  The following analysis assumes a typical software engineering context where a package name suggests a tool or library name.)*\n\n**Analysis & Synthesis:**\n\nThe provided metadata indicates a software package named `HEPSYCODE` residing within the namespace `org.univaq.hepsy`.  A minimal tool name derived solely from the package name would be a straightforward abbreviation or simplification of \"HEPSYCODE\".  Several options exist, depending on desired brevity and clarity:\n\n* **HEPSY:** This is the most concise option, retaining the core identifier.  However, it might lack specificity if other tools or libraries share a similar prefix.\n\n* **HEPSYCode:** This option maintains the original capitalization and is easily recognizable. It's a good balance between brevity and clarity.\n\n* **HepsyCode:** This option uses camel case, which is a common convention in software naming. It improves readability compared to the all-caps version.\n\n* **Hepsy:** This is a lower-case version of the shortened name, which might be preferred in certain coding styles or contexts.\n\nThe best choice depends on the specific context and naming conventions used within the `org.univaq.hepsy` project.  If there's a pre-existing naming standard, it should be followed.  Otherwise, `HEPSYCode` or `HepsyCode` are strong candidates due to their clarity and adherence to common software naming practices.  The choice of `HEPSY` should be considered only if brevity is paramount and there's no risk of ambiguity.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA minimal tool name derived solely from the `HEPSYCODE` package name could be `HEPSY`, `HEPSYCode`, `HepsyCode`, or `Hepsy`. The optimal choice depends on the project's naming conventions and the need for brevity versus clarity.  Further information about the project's naming standards would allow for a more definitive recommendation.\n\n\n**Metadata:**\n\n* **Query:** Minimal tool name derivation from `HEPSYCODE` package name.\n* **Source:**  *(No specific sources provided)*\n* **Date:** October 26, 2023\n* **Assumptions:** Standard software engineering practices for package and tool naming."
