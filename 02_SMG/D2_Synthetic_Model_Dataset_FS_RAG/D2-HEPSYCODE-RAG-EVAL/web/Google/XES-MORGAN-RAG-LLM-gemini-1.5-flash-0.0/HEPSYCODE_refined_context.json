    "context": "## Refined Context: Minimal Tool Name Derivation from Package Name\n\n**Query:** Derive a minimal tool name from the `HEPSYCODE` package name within the `org.univaq.hepsy` namespace URI.\n\n**Retrieved Documents & Metadata:**  *(No documents were provided.  The following analysis assumes a common practice for naming conventions based on package names.)*\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe provided metadata indicates a package named `HEPSYCODE` residing within the namespace `org.univaq.hepsy`.  To derive a minimal tool name solely from the package name, we need to apply a naming convention that is both concise and informative.  Several approaches are possible, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:\n\n* **Direct Use:** The simplest approach is to use the package name directly as the tool name:  `HEPSYCODE`. This is concise but might lack clarity if the acronym isn't widely understood.\n\n* **Acronymic Shortening:** If `HEPSYCODE` represents an acronym, this approach is ideal.  However, without knowing the full form, we cannot determine if this is appropriate.\n\n* **Title Case Conversion:** Converting the package name to title case (`Hepsycode`) improves readability and is a common practice for tool names.\n\n* **Abbreviation with Context:** If the full name is known and lengthy, a shorter, more descriptive abbreviation could be used, but this requires additional information not provided.\n\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nGiven the limited information, the most practical minimal tool name derived solely from the package name is **`Hepsycode`**. This approach offers readability and avoids ambiguity without requiring external knowledge.  However, a more informed decision could be made with additional context regarding the full form of `HEPSYCODE` and its intended use.\n\n\n**Metadata:**\n\n* **Query:** Minimal tool name derivation from `HEPSYCODE` package name.\n* **Source:**  *(No specific sources provided)*\n* **Assumptions:** Common software naming conventions are applied.  The lack of information about the full form of `HEPSYCODE` limits the options for abbreviation.\n* **Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile other naming conventions are possible, `Hepsycode` provides a balanced approach to conciseness and clarity based on the available information.  Further refinement of the tool name might be beneficial with additional context."
