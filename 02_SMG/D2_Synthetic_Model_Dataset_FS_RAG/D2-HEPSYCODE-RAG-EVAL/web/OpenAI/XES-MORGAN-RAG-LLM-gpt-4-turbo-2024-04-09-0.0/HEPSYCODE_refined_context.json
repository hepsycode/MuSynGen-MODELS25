    "context": "To determine a suitable name for a tool derived from the \"HEPSYCODE\" package, it is essential to understand the nature and functionality of HEPSYCODE itself, as well as the specific aspects of its metamodel that the new tool will emphasize or extend.\n\n**Understanding HEPSYCODE:**\nHEPSYCODE is a software package designed for high-level synthesis (HLS) of digital systems. HLS is a process in which an abstract behavioral description of a digital system, often written in a high-level programming language, is automatically converted into a hardware description language (HDL). This conversion facilitates the design of hardware at a higher level of abstraction, improving design efficiency and potentially reducing errors.\n\n**Metamodel of HEPSYCODE:**\nThe metamodel in a software context defines the model's structure, rules, and constraints. HEPSYCODE’s metamodel likely includes components that describe the syntax and semantics of the input languages it accepts, the transformations it performs, and the output it generates. The metamodel would also define how different elements relate to each other and the rules for their interaction, which are crucial for ensuring that the synthesized hardware design is functional and efficient.\n\n**Deriving a New Tool:**\nA new tool derived from HEPSYCODE’s metamodel would likely focus on one or more aspects of this synthesis process. For example, it might specialize in optimizing certain types of hardware designs, or it could extend HEPSYCODE’s capabilities to support additional input languages or target different hardware architectures.\n\n**Naming the New Tool:**\nThe name of the new tool should reflect its relationship to HEPSYCODE as well as its specific focus or enhancement. Here are a few suggestions based on different potential focuses of the tool:\n\n1. **MetaHEPSY**: This name suggests that the tool builds directly on the metamodel of HEPSYCODE, perhaps offering a more refined or extended metamodel that supports additional features or optimizations.\n\n2. **HEPSYOpt**: If the tool focuses on optimizing the output of the HLS process, this name would be appropriate, indicating a specialization in enhancing the efficiency or performance of the synthesized hardware.\n\n3. **HEPSYExtend**: Suitable for a tool that extends the capabilities of HEPSYCODE, such as by adding support for additional input languages or targeting new hardware platforms.\n\n4. **HEPSYArch**: This name could be used for a tool that specializes in generating hardware designs for specific types of architectures, indicating a focus on architectural considerations within the HLS process.\n\n5. **HEPSYLink**: If the new tool enhances the integration of HEPSYCODE with other software tools or platforms, this name would reflect its role in linking HEPSYCODE to broader systems or workflows.\n\nEach of these names provides a clear connection to the original HEPSYCODE package while also indicating the unique value or focus of the new tool. The choice of name should align with the most significant enhancements or capabilities that the new tool introduces to the HLS process."
