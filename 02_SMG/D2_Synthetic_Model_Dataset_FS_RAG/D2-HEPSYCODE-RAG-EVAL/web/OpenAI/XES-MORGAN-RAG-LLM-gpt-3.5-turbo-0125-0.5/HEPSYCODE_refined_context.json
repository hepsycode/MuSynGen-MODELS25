    "context": "**Refined Context:**\n\n**Tool Name:** HepsyCode Generator\n\n**Context:**\n\nThe HepsyCode Generator is a software tool designed to facilitate code generation based on the HEPSYCODE metamodel. The package name \"HEPSYCODE\" and its corresponding namespace URI \"org.univaq.hepsy\" serve as the foundation for this tool's functionality. While the metamodel information does not specify any classifiers, the HepsyCode Generator leverages the structural and semantic elements defined within the HEPSYCODE metamodel to automate the process of creating code snippets, templates, or entire software components.\n\nBy interpreting the metamodel structure provided by the HEPSYCODE package, the HepsyCode Generator offers a streamlined approach to software development by generating code artifacts that align with the specified modeling standards. This tool serves as a valuable resource for developers looking to expedite the implementation of software solutions while maintaining consistency and adherence to the HEPSYCODE metamodel.\n\nIn summary, the HepsyCode Generator is a powerful tool that harnesses the principles of the HEPSYCODE metamodel to enhance code generation processes, enabling developers to efficiently translate modeling concepts into executable code.\n\n**Metadata:**\n- Package Name: HEPSYCODE\n- Namespace URI: org.univaq.hepsy\n- Classifiers: None"
