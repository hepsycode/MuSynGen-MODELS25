    "context": "In order to generate the minimum context for a tool using the given metamodel information, it is important to first understand the basic principles of metamodeling. Metamodeling is a technique used in software engineering, and it provides a structured approach to defining the specifications, or meta-specifications, of a software tool or system. It helps in representing the structure, semantics, and constraints of the models in a specific domain.\n\nThe package name 'HEPSYCODE' and the namespace URI 'org.univaq.hepsy' that you provided are important parts of the metamodel for a tool. They form a kind of basic metadata for the tool which will help in setting up the context.\n\n1. Package Name: The package name 'HEPSYCODE' refers to the specific group or bundle of code files, libraries, and sub-packages that make up the tool in question. It serves to set the context for what type of tool you are working with.\n\n2. Namespace URI: The namespace URI 'org.univaq.hepsy' serves as a unique identifier for the tool and indicates where its resources are defined on the internet. This will help in understanding its origin and potentially finding further details about the tool.\n\n3. Direct Extraction of Tool Name: To ensure the tool's name is directly extracted from the package name, you need a systematic methodology or algorithm to derive the tool's name from the package name. You might need to use conventions such as capitalization, underscores, or periods to separate out the different parts of the name. However, without specific classifiers or strategies, the extraction process can be limited.\n\nDocument References:\nUnfortunately, there are no concrete documents provided for citation. Please provide relevant references for incorporating traceable metadata and more accurate context generation. It is important to maintain transparency and source integrity when synthesizing professional content, especially when handling information retrieval and content synthesis within a specialized field such as software metamodeling.\n\nTo compile data further, researching on related topics can help create a more robust context around the tool. Topics could include the purpose of the tool, its main functions and features, its development environment and requirements, as well as its common use-cases and user reviews. These details will not only expand the context but also provide a more comprehensive picture of the tool."
