    "context": "To create a minimal context for a tool based on the provided metamodel details, the process involves extracting and synthesizing key elements from the metamodel's metadata. The goal is to derive a concise representation of the tool, focusing on its name, which is inferred from the package name. Below is a detailed explanation of how this can be achieved:\n\n### 1. **Understanding the Provided Metamodel Details**\n   - **Package Name**: `HEPSYCODE`\n     - This serves as the primary identifier for the tool. The package name often reflects the tool's purpose or domain and is typically used as the basis for naming the tool.\n   - **Namespace URI**: `org.univaq.hepsy`\n     - The namespace URI provides a unique identifier for the package within a broader system or framework. While it is not directly used in naming the tool, it helps in distinguishing the package in a larger context.\n   - **Classifiers**: `None`\n     - The absence of classifiers indicates that there are no additional subcategories or specific elements defined within the package. This simplifies the context creation process, as there are no further details to incorporate.\n\n### 2. **Deriving the Tool's Name**\n   - The tool's name can be directly derived from the **Package Name**. In this case, the package name is `HEPSYCODE`, which will also serve as the minimal context's name for the tool.\n\n### 3. **Creating the Minimal Context**\n   - A minimal context for the tool includes only its name, which is derived from the package name. Since no classifiers are provided, and the namespace URI is not directly relevant to the tool's name, the context remains straightforward.\n\n### 4. **Refined Context**\n   Based on the provided details, the minimal context for the tool is as follows:\n\n   **Tool Name**: HEPSYCODE\n\n   This minimal context is sufficient to identify the tool within the scope of the provided metamodel details. It is concise and directly derived from the package name, ensuring clarity and simplicity.\n\n### 5. **Additional Notes**\n   - If further details about the tool's functionality, purpose, or domain are required in the future, they can be incorporated by analyzing the namespace URI or by adding classifiers when they become available.\n   - The namespace URI (`org.univaq.hepsy`) suggests that the tool may be associated with a specific organization or project (`univaq`) and a domain (`hepsy`), which could provide additional context if needed.\n\nBy following this approach, a minimal yet effective context for the tool is created, focusing solely on its name derived from the package name."
