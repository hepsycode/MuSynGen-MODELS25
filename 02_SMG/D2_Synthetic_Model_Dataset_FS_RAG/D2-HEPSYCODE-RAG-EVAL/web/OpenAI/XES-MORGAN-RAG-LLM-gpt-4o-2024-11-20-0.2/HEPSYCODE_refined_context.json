    "context": "To create a minimal context for a tool based solely on the provided metamodel details, the process involves deriving the tool's name directly from the package name and ensuring that the context remains concise while accurately reflecting the provided metadata. Below is a refined and comprehensive explanation:\n\n---\n\n### Creating a Minimal Context for a Tool\n\n**Objective**: To define a minimal context for a tool using the provided metamodel details, ensuring that the tool's name is derived directly from the package name.\n\n#### Provided Metamodel Details:\n- **Package Name**: HEPSYCODE\n- **Namespace URI**: org.univaq.hepsy\n- **Classifiers**: None\n\n#### Steps to Create the Minimal Context:\n1. **Derive the Tool's Name**:\n   - The tool's name is directly derived from the **Package Name**. In this case, the package name is `HEPSYCODE`. Therefore, the tool's name will also be `HEPSYCODE`.\n\n2. **Incorporate Relevant Metadata**:\n   - The **Namespace URI** (`org.univaq.hepsy`) provides additional context about the organizational or domain-specific origin of the tool. While not explicitly required for a minimal context, it can be referenced for traceability or integration purposes.\n   - The absence of **Classifiers** indicates that no specific subcategories or classifications are defined for this tool within the metamodel.\n\n3. **Define the Minimal Context**:\n   - The minimal context should include only the tool's name, as derived from the package name. Additional details, such as the namespace URI, can be omitted unless explicitly required.\n\n#### Minimal Context Example:\n- **Tool Name**: HEPSYCODE\n\nThis minimal context is sufficient to identify the tool while adhering to the constraints of simplicity and direct derivation from the package name.\n\n#### Additional Notes:\n- If further elaboration or integration into a broader system is required, the **Namespace URI** can serve as a reference point for locating or associating the tool within its domain.\n- The absence of classifiers simplifies the context, ensuring that no additional categorizations or attributes need to be considered.\n\nBy following this approach, a minimal yet precise context for the tool `HEPSYCODE` is established, aligning with the provided metamodel details.\n\n--- \n\nThis explanation synthesizes the provided information into a clear and structured response, ensuring traceability and adherence to the requirements of minimalism."
