    "context": "# HEPSYCODE: A Comprehensive Guide\n\n## Overview\nHEPSYCODE is a specialized tool designed to facilitate the analysis and management of metamodels within the namespace `org.univaq.hepsy`. This tool is particularly useful for developers and researchers who need to work with complex metamodels, providing a structured approach to analyze and manipulate these models efficiently. HEPSYCODE leverages advanced technologies and methodologies to ensure accuracy and reliability in metamodel analysis.\n\n## Tool Name\nHEPSYCODE\n\n## Technical Details\nHEPSYCODE is built using a combination of modern technologies and methodologies to ensure robust performance and ease of use. The tool is designed to handle metamodels within the `org.univaq.hepsy` namespace, providing a comprehensive set of features for analysis and management. Key technologies and tools used in HEPSYCODE include:\n\n- **Programming Languages**: Java, Python\n- **Frameworks**: Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), Apache Maven\n- **Methodologies**: Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), Domain-Specific Languages (DSL)\n\nHEPSYCODE employs these technologies to provide a seamless experience for users, allowing them to focus on the analysis and management of metamodels without worrying about the underlying complexities.\n\n## Installation and Setup Instructions\nTo download, configure, and install HEPSYCODE, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prerequisites**:\n   - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later installed.\n   - Install Apache Maven.\n\n2. **Download HEPSYCODE**:\n   - Clone the HEPSYCODE repository from GitHub:\n     ```sh\n     git clone https://github.com/univaq/hepsycode.git\n     ```\n\n3. **Build the Project**:\n   - Navigate to the project directory:\n     ```sh\n     cd hepsycode\n     ```\n   - Build the project using Maven:\n     ```sh\n     mvn clean install\n     ```\n\n4. **Configuration**:\n   - Configure the tool by editing the `config.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory.\n   - Set the necessary parameters such as input metamodel paths and output directories.\n\n5. **Run HEPSYCODE**:\n   - Execute the tool using the following command:\n     ```sh\n     java -jar target/hepsycode.jar\n     ```\n\n## System Requirements\nHEPSYCODE has the following system requirements and dependencies:\n\n- **Operating Systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux\n- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or later\n- **Apache Maven**: Version 3.6 or later\n- **Memory**: Minimum 4 GB RAM\n- **Disk Space**: Minimum 500 MB of free disk space\n\n## Tutorial\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to effectively use HEPSYCODE:\n\n1. **Prepare Your Metamodel**:\n   - Ensure your metamodel is defined within the `org.univaq.hepsy` namespace.\n   - Save your metamodel file in a accessible directory.\n\n2. **Configure HEPSYCODE**:\n   - Open the `config.properties` file and set the `input.metamodel.path` to the location of your metamodel file.\n   - Set the `output.directory` to the desired output location.\n\n3. **Run the Analysis**:\n   - Execute HEPSYCODE using the command:\n     ```sh\n     java -jar target/hepsycode.jar\n     ```\n   - The tool will process the metamodel and generate the analysis results in the specified output directory.\n\n4. **Review the Results**:\n   - Navigate to the output directory and review the generated analysis reports.\n   - Use the reports to gain insights into the structure and characteristics of your metamodel.\n\n## References\nFor more detailed information and documentation, refer to the following resources:\n\n- [HEPSYCODE GitHub Repository](https://github.com/univaq/hepsycode)\n- [Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/)\n- [Apache Maven Documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html)\n- [Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) Principles](https://www.omg.org/mda/)\n\nBy following this comprehensive guide, you should be able to effectively use HEPSYCODE for your metamodel analysis and management needs."
