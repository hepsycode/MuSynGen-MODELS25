    "context": "# HEPSYCODE: A Comprehensive Guide\n\n## Overview\nHEPSYCODE is a specialized tool designed for the analysis and manipulation of metamodels within the namespace `org.univaq.hepsy`. This tool is particularly useful for developers and researchers who need to work with complex metamodels, providing a robust framework for analysis, validation, and transformation of these models. HEPSYCODE leverages advanced algorithms and data structures to ensure efficiency and accuracy in metamodel processing.\n\n## Tool Name\nHEPSYCODE\n\n## Technical Details\nHEPSYCODE utilizes a variety of technologies and methodologies to achieve its goals:\n\n- **Programming Languages**: Primarily developed in Java, HEPSYCODE takes advantage of the language's robustness and wide range of libraries.\n- **Data Structures**: Employs efficient data structures such as graphs and trees to represent and manipulate metamodels.\n- **Algorithms**: Incorporates algorithms for model validation, transformation, and optimization.\n- **Frameworks**: Integrates with popular frameworks like Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) for enhanced functionality and compatibility.\n\n## Installation and Setup Instructions\nTo download, configure, and install HEPSYCODE, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Download**: Obtain the latest release of HEPSYCODE from the official repository or website.\n2. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or later installed on your system.\n3. **Installation**:\n   - Extract the downloaded archive to a preferred directory.\n   - Navigate to the extracted directory using the command line.\n   - Run the installation script provided (e.g., `install.sh` for Unix-based systems or `install.bat` for Windows).\n4. **Configuration**:\n   - Edit the configuration file (`config.properties`) to set up the necessary parameters such as input/output directories, logging levels, etc.\n   - Ensure that all dependencies are correctly configured in your development environment.\n\n## System Requirements\nHEPSYCODE has the following system requirements:\n\n- **Operating Systems**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n- **Java**: Requires JDK 11 or later.\n- **Memory**: Minimum of 4 GB RAM recommended for optimal performance.\n- **Disk Space**: At least 500 MB of free disk space for installation and additional space for model storage.\n- **Dependencies**:\n  - Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)\n  - Apache Commons libraries\n  - Other specific libraries as mentioned in the documentation.\n\n## Tutorial\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Using HEPSYCODE\n\n1. **Launching the Tool**:\n   - Open your command line interface.\n   - Navigate to the installation directory of HEPSYCODE.\n   - Run the command `java -jar hepsycode.jar` to start the tool.\n\n2. **Loading a Metamodel**:\n   - Use the `load` command followed by the path to your metamodel file (e.g., `load /path/to/metamodel.xmi`).\n   - The tool will parse and load the metamodel into memory.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Metamodel**:\n   - Execute the `analyze` command to perform a comprehensive analysis of the loaded metamodel.\n   - The tool will output various metrics and insights about the metamodel structure.\n\n4. **Transforming the Metamodel**:\n   - Use the `transform` command to apply predefined transformations to the metamodel.\n   - Specify the transformation type and parameters as needed (e.g., `transform --type optimization --param value`).\n\n5. **Saving the Results**:\n   - Save the analyzed or transformed metamodel using the `save` command followed by the desired output path (e.g., `save /path/to/output.xmi`).\n\n6. **Generating Reports**:\n   - Generate detailed reports of the analysis or transformation process using the `report` command.\n   - Specify the report format and output path (e.g., `report --format pdf --output /path/to/report.pdf`).\n\n## References\n- [HEPSYCODE Official Documentation](#)\n- [Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/)\n- [Apache Commons Libraries](https://commons.apache.org/)\n- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)\n\nThis comprehensive guide should help you get started with HEPSYCODE, from installation to effective usage.
