It is developed under the namespace `org.univaq.hepsy` and is tailored to support researchers and physicists in modeling, simulating, and analyzing complex particle interactions and phenomena in high-energy physics. The tool leverages advanced computational techniques and algorithms to provide accurate and efficient simulations, making it a valuable resource for both academic research and experimental applications.\n\nHEPSYCODE is particularly useful for:\n- Simulating particle collisions and interactions.\n- Generating code for custom physics models.\n- Analyzing simulation data for experimental validation.\n- Integrating with other HEP tools and frameworks for collaborative research.\n\n## Tool Name\n**HEPSYCODE**\n\n## Technical Details\nHEPSYCODE is built using a combination of modern programming languages and frameworks to ensure high performance and flexibility. Key technical aspects include:\n\n- **Programming Languages**: Java, Python, and C++ for different components.\n- **Frameworks**: Integration with ROOT (a data analysis framework widely used in HEP), Geant4 (for particle simulation), and other physics-specific libraries.\n- **Methodologies**:\n  - **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Used for probabilistic modeling of particle interactions.\n  - **Event Generation**: Capabilities to generate and analyze particle collision events.\n  - **Code Generation**: Automated generation of simulation code based on user-defined models.\n- **Data Formats**: Support for HEP-specific data formats such as HEPData, ROOT files, and custom output formats.\n- **Parallel Computing**: Optimized for parallel processing to handle large-scale simulations efficiently.\n\n## Installation and Setup Instructions\nTo install and set up HEPSYCODE, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher.\n- Python 3.8 or higher.\n- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang).\n- ROOT framework (optional but recommended for data analysis).\n\n### Steps\n1. **Download the Tool**:\n   - Clone the HEPSYCODE repository from its official GitHub page:\n     ```bash\n     git clone https://github.com/univaq-hepsy/hepsycode.git\n     ```\n   - Alternatively, download the latest release as a ZIP file from the [releases page](https://github.com/univaq-hepsy/hepsycode/releases).\n\n2. **Build the Project**:\n   - Navigate to the project directory:\n     ```bash\n     cd hepsycode\n     ```\n   - Build the Java components using Maven:\n     ```bash\n     mvn clean install\n     ```\n   - Build the C++ components (if applicable) using CMake:\n     ```bash\n     mkdir build\n     cd build\n     cmake ..\n     make\n     ```\n\n3. **Configure the Environment**:\n   - Set the `HEPSYCODE_HOME` environment variable to point to the installation directory:\n     ```bash\n     export HEPSYCODE_HOME=/path/to/hepsycode\n     ```\n   - Add the tool's binary directory to your system's PATH:\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=$HEPSYCODE_HOME/bin:$PATH\n     ```\n\n4. **Verify the Installation**:\n   - Run the following command to check if HEPSYCODE is installed correctly:\n     ```bash\n     hepsycode --version\n     ```\n\n## System Requirements\nHEPSYCODE is designed to run on modern operating systems with the following minimum requirements:\n\n- **Operating System**: Linux (recommended), macOS, or Windows.\n- **Memory**: 8 GB RAM (16 GB recommended for large simulations).\n- **Storage**: 5 GB of free disk space.\n- **Dependencies**:\n  - Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher.\n  - Python 3.8 or higher.\n  - C++ compiler (GCC 7.0 or higher, Clang 7.0 or higher).\n  - ROOT framework (version 6.24 or higher).\n  - Geant4 (optional, for advanced simulations).\n\n## Tutorial\nThis tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to using HEPSYCODE for a basic high-energy physics simulation.\n\n### Step 1: Define a Physics Model\n1. Create a new directory for your project:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir my_hep_simulation\n   cd my_hep_simulation\n   ```\n2. Create a configuration file (`model.json`) to define the physics model:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"particles\": [\n       {\n         \"name\": \"electron\",\n         \"mass\": 0.000511,\n         \"charge\": -1\n       },\n       {\n         \"name\": \"proton\",\n         \"mass\": 0.938,\n         \"charge\": 1\n       }\n     ],\n     \"interactions\": [\n       {\n         \"type\": \"elastic\",\n         \"particles\": [\"electron\", \"proton\"]\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Generate Simulation Code\n1. Use HEPSYCODE to generate the simulation code:\n   ```bash\n   hepsycode generate --config model.json\n   ```\n   This command will create a new directory (`simulation`) containing the generated code.\n\n### Step 3: Run the Simulation\n1. Navigate to the simulation directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd simulation\n   ```\n2. Compile the generated code:\n   ```bash\n   make\n   ```\n3. Run the simulation:\n   ```bash\n   ./simulation --output results.root\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Results\n1. Use the ROOT framework to analyze the simulation output:\n   ```python\n   import ROOT\n\n   # Open the output file\n   file = ROOT.TFile(\"results.root\")\n\n   # Access the data (e.g., histograms)\n   histogram = file.Get(\"event_histogram\")\n   histogram.Draw()\n   ```\n\n## References\n- **Official HEPSYCODE GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/univaq-hepsy/hepsycode](https://github.com/univaq-hepsy/hepsycode)\n- **Documentation**: [HEPSYCODE Documentation](https://univaq-hepsy.github.io/hepsycode/)\n- **ROOT Framework**: [https://root.cern](https://root.cern)\n- **Geant4 Simulation Toolkit**: [https://geant4.web.cern.ch](https://geant4.web.cern.ch)\n- **High-Energy Physics Data (HEPData)**: [https://hepdata.net](https://hepdata.net)\n\nFor further assistance, you can contact the HEPSYCODE development team or contribute to the project on GitHub."
