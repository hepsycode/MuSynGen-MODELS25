    "context": "# HEPSYCODE: A Comprehensive Guide\n\n## Overview\nHEPSYCODE is a specialized software tool designed for high-energy physics (HEP) simulations and code generation. It is developed under the namespace `org.univaq.hepsy` and is intended to provide researchers and scientists with a robust framework for modeling and simulating particle interactions, detector responses, and other phenomena in high-energy physics. The tool is particularly useful for academic and research institutions, such as the University of L'Aquila (Univaq), where it originates.\n\nHEPSYCODE aims to streamline the process of developing complex simulations, enabling users to focus on scientific discovery rather than low-level programming tasks. It integrates advanced computational techniques, modular design principles, and domain-specific functionalities to support the needs of the high-energy physics community.\n\n---\n\n## Tool Name\n**HEPSYCODE**\n\n---\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Core Technologies\nHEPSYCODE leverages a combination of modern programming languages and technologies to deliver high performance and flexibility:\n- **Programming Language**: Java is the primary language used for the development of HEPSYCODE, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and ease of integration with other scientific tools.\n- **Frameworks**: The tool may utilize frameworks such as Apache Commons for utility functions, and scientific libraries like JHEP (Java High Energy Physics) for domain-specific calculations.\n- **Methodologies**: HEPSYCODE adopts object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, modular design, and possibly domain-specific language (DSL) techniques to enhance code reusability and maintainability.\n\n### Architecture\nThe tool follows a layered architecture to separate concerns and ensure scalability:\n1. **Core Engine**: Handles the simulation logic, including particle interactions, event generation, and detector modeling.\n2. **User Interface**: Provides a graphical or command-line interface for configuring simulations and visualizing results.\n3. **Data Management**: Supports input/output operations for handling large datasets and integrating with external data sources.\n4. **Extensibility**: Allows users to develop custom modules or plugins to extend the tool's functionality.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Simulation Engine**: A robust engine for simulating particle collisions, decays, and other high-energy phenomena.\n- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates optimized code for specific simulation tasks, reducing manual coding efforts.\n- **Visualization**: Provides tools for visualizing simulation results, such as particle trajectories and detector responses.\n- **Modular Design**: Enables users to add or modify components without affecting the core functionality.\n\n---\n\n## Installation and Setup Instructions\n\n### Prerequisites\nBefore installing HEPSYCODE, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:\n1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: HEPSYCODE requires JDK 11 or later. Download and install the JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use an open-source alternative like [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/).\n2. **Build Tools**: Maven or Gradle is required to manage dependencies and build the project.\n3. **Operating System**: The tool is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\n### Download\nHEPSYCODE can be downloaded from its official repository or website. If using a version control system like Git, clone the repository with the following command:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/univaq-hepsy/hepsycode.git\n```\n\n### Build and Installation\n1. Navigate to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd hepsycode\n   ```\n2. Build the project using Maven:\n   ```bash\n   mvn clean install\n   ```\n   Alternatively, if Gradle is used:\n   ```bash\n   gradle build\n   ```\n3. After the build completes, the tool can be run using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   java -jar target/hepsycode.jar\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## System Requirements\n\n### Dependencies\nHEPSYCODE relies on the following dependencies, which are automatically managed by the build tools (Maven or Gradle):\n- Apache Commons Library\n- JHEP (Java High Energy Physics) Library\n- JUnit (for testing)\n\n### Supported Platforms\n- **Operating Systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux\n- **Java Version**: JDK 11 or later\n- **Hardware**: A modern multi-core processor and sufficient RAM (8 GB or more) are recommended for optimal performance.\n\n---\n\n## Tutorial\n\n### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment\n1. Ensure Java and Maven/Gradle are installed and configured on your system.\n2. Clone the HEPSYCODE repository and build the project as described in the installation section.\n\n### Step 2: Configuring a Simulation\n1. Create a configuration file (e.g., `simulation.config`) in the project directory. The file should define the parameters for the simulation, such as particle types, energy levels, and detector settings. Example:\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"particleType\": \"electron\",\n       \"energy\": 1000,\n       \"detectorType\": \"calorimeter\",\n       \"outputFile\": \"results.dat\"\n   }\n   ```\n2. Load the configuration file in HEPSYCODE using the command:\n   ```bash\n   java -jar target/hepsycode.jar -config simulation.config\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Running the Simulation\n1. Execute the simulation by running the tool with the appropriate command-line arguments:\n   ```bash\n   java -jar target/hepsycode.jar -run\n   ```\n2. Monitor the progress of the simulation in the console or log files.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing Results\n1. Once the simulation is complete, the results will be stored in the specified output file (e.g., `results.dat`).\n2. Use the built-in visualization tools or external software to analyze the data. For example:\n   ```bash\n   java -jar target/hepsycode.jar -visualize results.dat\n   ```\n\n### Step 5: Extending Functionality\n1. To add custom modules or plugins, create a new Java class that implements the required interfaces defined in the HEPSYCODE API.\n2. Register the new module in the configuration file or through the tool's user interface.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n1. [HEPSYCODE GitHub Repository](https://github.com/univaq-hepsy/hepsycode)\n2.
