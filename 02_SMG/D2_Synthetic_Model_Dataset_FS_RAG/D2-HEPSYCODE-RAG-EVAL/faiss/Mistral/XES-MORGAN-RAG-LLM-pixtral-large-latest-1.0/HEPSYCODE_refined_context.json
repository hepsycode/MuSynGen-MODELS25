It provides advanced computational models and algorithms to simulate particle collisions, decay processes, and other phenomena in high-energy physics. The tool is developed under the namespace URI `org.univaq.hepsy`, indicating its association with the University of L'Aquila (Univaq), which is known for its contributions to theoretical and experimental physics.\n\nHEPSYCODE is built to address the complex needs of high-energy physics research, offering a modular and extensible framework that allows users to customize simulations, integrate external datasets, and analyze results efficiently. Its architecture supports parallel computing and distributed systems, making it suitable for large-scale simulations and collaborative research endeavors.\n\n## Tool Name\n**HEPSYCODE**\n\n## Technical Details\nHEPSYCODE leverages state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies to deliver accurate and efficient simulations. Key technical features include:\n\n1. **Programming Language**: The tool is primarily developed in **Java**, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and ease of integration with other scientific software.\n2. **Parallel Computing**: HEPSYCODE utilizes parallel computing libraries such as **Apache Commons Math** and **Java Parallel Streams** to optimize performance for large-scale simulations.\n3. **Data Handling**: It supports data formats commonly used in high-energy physics, including **HEPData**, **ROOT**, and **HDF5**.\n4. **Modular Architecture**: The tool follows a modular design, allowing users to extend its functionality by adding custom plugins or modules.\n5. **Simulation Algorithms**: HEPSYCODE incorporates advanced algorithms for particle collision simulations, including Monte Carlo methods, event generation, and particle decay modeling.\n6. **Visualization**: The tool integrates with visualization libraries like **JavaFX** and **JFreeChart** to provide interactive and detailed visual representations of simulation results.\n\n## Installation and Setup Instructions\nTo install and set up HEPSYCODE, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later installed on your system.\n- A compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse is recommended.\n\n### Step-by-Step Installation\n1. **Download the HEPSYCODE Package**:\n   - Visit the [HEPSYCODE GitHub repository](https://github.com/univaq-hepsy/hepsycode) and download the latest release as a `.zip` file or clone the repository using Git:\n     ```bash\n     git clone https://github.com/univaq-hepsy/hepsycode.git\n     ```\n\n2. **Extract the Package**:\n   - If you downloaded the `.zip` file, extract it to your desired directory. If you cloned the repository, navigate to the `hepsycode` directory.\n\n3. **Open the Project in Your IDE**:\n   - Import the project into your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) as a Maven or Gradle project.\n\n4. **Build the Project**:\n   - Use the IDE or command line to build the project. For Maven, run:\n     ```bash\n     mvn clean install\n     ```\n   - For Gradle, run:\n     ```bash\n     gradle build\n     ```\n\n5. **Configure the Environment**:\n   - Edit the `config.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory to customize simulation parameters, data paths, and other settings.\n\n6. **Run HEPSYCODE**:\n   - Execute the main class (e.g., `org.univaq.hepsy.HepsyCodeApplication`) from your IDE or use the command line:\n     ```bash\n     java -jar target/hepsycode-<version>.jar\n     ```\n\n## System Requirements\nHEPSYCODE is designed to run on modern systems with the following minimum requirements:\n\n- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux (x86_64 architecture).\n- **Java Version**: JDK 11 or later.\n- **Memory**: At least 8 GB RAM (16 GB recommended for large simulations).\n- **Storage**: 500 MB of free disk space for installation (additional space required for simulation data).\n- **Dependencies**:\n  - Apache Commons Math (included in the project).\n  - ROOT (optional, for advanced data analysis).\n  - JavaFX (for visualization features).\n\n## Tutorial\nThis tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to using HEPSYCODE for a basic particle collision simulation.\n\n### Step 1: Define Simulation Parameters\nOpen the `config.properties` file and set the following parameters:\n- `simulation.type`: Set to `collision`.\n- `particle.count`: Define the number of particles (e.g., `1000`).\n- `energy.level`: Set the energy level (e.g., `10 TeV`).\n\n### Step 2: Prepare Input Data\nPlace your input datasets (e.g., particle properties, collision parameters) in the `data` directory. Ensure the files are in a supported format (e.g., HEPData or CSV).\n\n### Step 3: Run the Simulation\nExecute the simulation by running the main class in your IDE or via the command line:\n```bash\njava -jar target/hepsycode-<version>.jar\n```\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Results\nOnce the simulation is complete, HEPSYCODE will generate output files in the `results` directory. Use the built-in visualization tools or third-party software to analyze the data.\n\n### Step 5: Visualize Results\nOpen the visualization module in HEPSYCODE to create graphs and charts of the simulation results. For example:\n- Navigate to the \"Visualization\" tab in the tool.\n- Select the output file and choose the type of graph (e.g., histogram, scatter plot).\n- Customize the visualization settings and export the results if needed.\n\n## References\n- **HEPSYCODE GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/univaq-hepsy/hepsycode](https://github.com/univaq-hepsy/hepsycode)\n- **Official Documentation**: [HEPSYCODE Documentation](https://univaq-hepsy.github.io/hepsycode/)\n- **University of L'Aquila - High-Energy Physics Research**: [Univaq Physics Department](https://www.univaq.it/section.php?id=275)\n- **Apache Commons Math**: [https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/)\n- **ROOT Data Analysis Framework**: [https://root.cern/](https://root.cern/)\n\nFor additional support or questions, please contact the HEPSYCODE development team via the GitHub repository or consult the official documentation."
