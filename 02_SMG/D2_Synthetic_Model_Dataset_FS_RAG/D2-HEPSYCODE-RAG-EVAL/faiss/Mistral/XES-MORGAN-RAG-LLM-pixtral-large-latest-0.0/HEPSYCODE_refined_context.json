It is developed under the namespace `org.univaq.hepsy` and is tailored to support researchers and physicists in modeling, simulating, and analyzing complex particle interactions and phenomena. The tool leverages advanced computational techniques and algorithms to provide accurate and efficient simulations, making it a valuable asset in the field of theoretical and experimental physics.\n\nHEPSYCODE is particularly useful for:\n- Simulating particle collisions and interactions.\n- Generating code for custom physics models.\n- Analyzing simulation data for research and experimental purposes.\n- Integrating with other HEP tools and frameworks for collaborative work.\n\n## Tool Name\n**HEPSYCODE**\n\n## Technical Details\nHEPSYCODE is built using a combination of modern programming languages and frameworks to ensure high performance and scalability. Key technical aspects include:\n\n### Programming Languages\n- **Java**: The core of HEPSYCODE is written in Java, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and robust performance.\n- **Python**: Scripting and data analysis components are implemented in Python, providing flexibility and ease of use.\n\n### Technologies and Frameworks\n- **Apache Commons Math**: Used for mathematical computations and statistical analysis.\n- **ROOT**: Integrated for data visualization and analysis, a standard tool in the HEP community.\n- **JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding)**: Utilized for XML data handling and configuration.\n\n### Methodologies\n- **Object-Oriented Design**: The tool follows object-oriented principles to ensure modularity and reusability.\n- **Modular Architecture**: HEPSYCODE is designed with a modular architecture, allowing users to extend or customize functionalities as needed.\n- **Parallel Computing**: Supports parallel processing to handle large-scale simulations efficiently.\n\n## Installation and Setup Instructions\nTo install and set up HEPSYCODE, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher.\n- Python 3.8 or higher.\n- Apache Maven for building the project.\n\n### Steps\n1. **Clone the Repository**:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/univaq/hepsycode.git\n   cd hepsycode\n   ```\n\n2. **Build the Project**:\n   ```bash\n   mvn clean install\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure Environment Variables**:\n   Set the `HEPSYCODE_HOME` environment variable to the root directory of the project.\n   ```bash\n   export HEPSYCODE_HOME=/path/to/hepsycode\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Tool**:\n   ```bash\n   java -jar $HEPSYCODE_HOME/target/hepsycode.jar\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Installation**:\n   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the HEPSYCODE interface.\n\n## System Requirements\nHEPSYCODE is designed to run on various platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. The following dependencies are required:\n\n- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 or later), macOS (10.15 or later), Windows 10 or later.\n- **Memory**: Minimum 8 GB RAM (16 GB recommended for large simulations).\n- **Disk Space**: At least 10 GB of free disk space.\n- **Dependencies**:\n  - Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher.\n  - Python 3.8 or higher.\n  - Apache Maven 3.6 or higher.\n  - ROOT framework (optional, for advanced data analysis).\n\n## Tutorial\nThis tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to using HEPSYCODE for a basic simulation and code generation task.\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Simulation Project\n1. Open HEPSYCODE and navigate to the \"Projects\" tab.\n2. Click \"Create New Project\" and provide a name and description.\n3. Select the type of simulation (e.g., particle collision, decay process).\n\n### Step 2: Configure Simulation Parameters\n1. Go to the \"Simulation Settings\" tab.\n2. Define the parameters for the simulation, such as particle types, energies, and interaction models.\n3. Save the configuration.\n\n### Step 3: Run the Simulation\n1. Click the \"Run Simulation\" button.\n2. Monitor the progress in the \"Simulation Status\" tab.\n3. Once complete, download the simulation results.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Results\n1. Use the integrated ROOT framework to visualize the simulation data.\n2. Generate plots and graphs to interpret the results.\n3. Export the analysis for further research or publication.\n\n### Step 5: Generate Code\n1. Navigate to the \"Code Generation\" tab.\n2. Select the simulation model and parameters.\n3. Click \"Generate Code\" to produce custom code for the model.\n4. Download the generated code for integration into other projects.\n\n## References\n- **HEPSYCODE GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/univaq/hepsycode](https://github.com/univaq/hepsycode)\n- **HEPSYCODE Documentation**: [https://hepsycode.readthedocs.io](https://hepsycode.readthedocs.io)\n- **ROOT Framework**: [https://root.cern](https://root.cern)\n- **Apache Commons Math**: [https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math)\n\nFor further assistance, contact the HEPSYCODE support team at [support@hepsycode.org](mailto:support@hepsycode.org)."
