It is developed by the University of L'Aquila (UNIVAQ) and is part of the org.univaq.hepsy namespace. The tool is designed to facilitate the modeling, design, and code generation of complex embedded systems, which often involve a mix of hardware and software components.\n\n## Tool Name\n\nThe tool's name, HEPSYCODE, is derived directly from the package name in the metamodel.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nHEPSYCODE is built on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), a modeling framework and code generation facility for building tools and other applications based on a structured data model. It uses the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) for creating graphical editors and the Xpand language for code generation.\n\nThe tool supports the design of heterogeneous systems by providing a graphical editor for system modeling, a set of transformation rules for design space exploration, and a code generation facility for the final implementation.\n\n## Installation and Setup Instructions\n\nTo install HEPSYCODE, follow these steps:\n\n1. Download the latest version of Eclipse Modeling Tools from the Eclipse website.\n2. Install the EMF and GMF plugins through the Eclipse Marketplace.\n3. Download the HEPSYCODE tool from the official repository.\n4. Import the HEPSYCODE project into your Eclipse workspace.\n\n## System Requirements\n\nHEPSYCODE requires the following:\n\n- Eclipse Modeling Tools (latest version recommended)\n- EMF and GMF plugins\n- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or higher\n\nThe tool is platform-independent and can be run on any system that supports the required software.\n\n## Tutorial\n\nTo use HEPSYCODE, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the HEPSYCODE project in your Eclipse workspace.\n2. Create a new model using the graphical editor.\n3. Define your system by adding and configuring components.\n4. Run the transformation rules to explore the design space.\n5. Generate the code for your system.\n\nFor a more detailed tutorial, refer to the official HEPSYCODE documentation.\n\n## References\n\n- [Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/)\n- [Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF)](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/gmp/)\n- [HEPSYCODE Official Repository](https://github.com/univaq-hepsy/HEPSYCODE)\n\nFor more information, refer to the official HEPSYCODE documentation and the EMF and GMF documentation."
