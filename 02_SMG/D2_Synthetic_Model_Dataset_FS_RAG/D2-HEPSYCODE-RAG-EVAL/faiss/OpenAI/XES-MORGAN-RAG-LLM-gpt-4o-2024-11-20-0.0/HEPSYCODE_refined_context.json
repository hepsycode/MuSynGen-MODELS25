Overview\nHEPSYCODE (Hardware/Software Embedded System Design and Simulation Tool) is a specialized tool designed to facilitate the modeling, simulation, and co-design of hardware/software embedded systems. It is particularly useful for engineers and researchers working on complex embedded systems, enabling them to optimize the design process by integrating hardware and software components seamlessly. HEPSYCODE provides a framework for system-level design, allowing users to model, simulate, and analyze the performance of embedded systems before implementation.\n\nThe tool is based on the principles of model-driven engineering (MDE) and leverages a metamodeling approach to define and simulate the interactions between hardware and software components. By using HEPSYCODE, developers can reduce development time, improve system reliability, and ensure that the final product meets performance requirements.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Tool Name\n**HEPSYCODE**  \nDerived directly from the package name in the metamodel: `org.univaq.hepsy`.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Technical Details\nHEPSYCODE is built on a robust framework that integrates various technologies and methodologies to support the co-design of embedded systems. Key technical features include:\n\n- **Model-Driven Engineering (MDE):** HEPSYCODE uses a metamodeling approach to define the structure and behavior of embedded systems.\n- **Hardware/Software Co-Design:** The tool allows simultaneous design and optimization of hardware and software components.\n- **Simulation Capabilities:** Users can simulate system behavior to evaluate performance metrics such as timing, power consumption, and resource utilization.\n- **Extensibility:** HEPSYCODE supports customization and extension through plugins or additional modules.\n- **Integration with UML/MARTE:** The tool supports Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE) profiles for system modeling.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Installation and Setup Instructions\nTo install and set up HEPSYCODE, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Ensure that Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher is installed on your system.\n- Install Eclipse IDE (preferably the latest version) with support for modeling tools.\n- Download the HEPSYCODE package from the official repository or website.\n\n### Installation Steps\n1. **Download HEPSYCODE:**\n   - Visit the official HEPSYCODE repository or website and download the latest version of the tool.\n\n2. **Install Eclipse Modeling Tools:**\n   - Open Eclipse IDE.\n   - Go to `Help > Install New Software`.\n   - Add the update site for Eclipse Modeling Tools and install the required plugins (e.g., EMF, UML, MARTE).\n\n3. **Import HEPSYCODE:**\n   - Extract the downloaded HEPSYCODE package.\n   - In Eclipse, go to `File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace`.\n   - Select the HEPSYCODE project folder and click `Finish`.\n\n4. **Configure the Environment:**\n   - Set up the required dependencies and libraries as specified in the documentation.\n   - Ensure that the Java Build Path includes all necessary JAR files.\n\n5. **Run HEPSYCODE:**\n   - Launch the tool from Eclipse by running the main class or using the provided launch configuration.\n\n---\n\n## 5. System Requirements\nTo run HEPSYCODE effectively, ensure your system meets the following requirements:\n\n### Hardware\n- **Processor:** Dual-core processor or higher.\n- **RAM:** Minimum 4 GB (8 GB recommended for large projects).\n- **Storage:** At least 500 MB of free disk space.\n\n### Software\n- **Operating System:** Windows 10, macOS 10.15 or later, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 or later).\n- **Java:** JDK 8 or higher.\n- **Eclipse IDE:** Latest version with modeling tools support.\n- **Dependencies:** EMF, UML, MARTE plugins for Eclipse.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Tutorial\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Using HEPSYCODE\n1. **Create a New Project:**\n   - Open HEPSYCODE in Eclipse.\n   - Go to `File > New > Project` and select the HEPSYCODE project template.\n\n2. **Define the System Model:**\n   - Use the graphical editor to create a model of your embedded system.\n   - Define hardware components (e.g., processors, memory) and software tasks.\n\n3. **Specify Interactions:**\n   - Use the tool's interface to define interactions between hardware and software components.\n   - Set parameters such as communication protocols and timing constraints.\n\n4. **Simulate the System:**\n   - Run the simulation to evaluate system performance.\n   - Analyze the results using the built-in performance metrics.\n\n5. **Optimize the Design:**\n   - Modify the model based on simulation results to improve performance.\n   - Iterate the process until the desired performance is achieved.\n\n6. **Export the Model:**\n   - Export the final model for implementation or further analysis.\n\n---\n\n## 7.
