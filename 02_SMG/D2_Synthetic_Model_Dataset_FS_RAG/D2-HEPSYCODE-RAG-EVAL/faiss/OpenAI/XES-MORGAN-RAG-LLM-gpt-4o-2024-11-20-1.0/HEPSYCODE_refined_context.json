It primarily targets cyber-physical systems (CPS), embedded systems, and those operating in domains requiring the combination of different hardware and software components. The tool provides facilities for the co-design of hardware and software architectures, facilitating seamless development of heterogeneous systems by optimizing how software tasks interact with underlying hardware platforms. At its core, HEPSYCODE enhances system efficiency while reducing time-to-market for complex embedded systems.\n\n## Tool Name\nThe tool's name is **HEPSYCODE**, derived directly from the package name identified in the metamodel.\n\n## Technical Details\nHEPSYCODE is designed to address the challenges of designing complex systems involving multi-core and heterogeneous architectures. Its technical foundation resides in:\n\n- **Cyber-Physical System Co-design**: Coordinates between hardware assets (such as processors, FPGAs) and software tasks.\n- **Model-driven Development (MDD)**: Leverages models to abstract the complexity of the system into understandable frameworks.\n- **Code Generation**: Produces both hardware and software code, ensuring synchronization and compatibility.\n- **Heterogeneous System Optimization**: Supports various platforms and integrates multiple hardware-guided and software-guided optimization techniques.\n  \nKey features include:\n- **Mapping Algorithms** that balance workload between hardware and software.\n- **Task Scheduling** for time- and resource-efficient performance.\n- **Simulation and Validation** for verifying system functionality pre-deployment.\n- Integration with UML-like tools for diagrammatic representations of systems.\n\nIn practice, HEPSYCODE provides functionalities to translate the high-level architectural design of a system into its practical implementation, focusing on ensuring interoperability and consistency between the hardware and software components.\n\n## Installation and Setup Instructions\nFollow these steps to install and configure **HEPSYCODE**:\n\n1. **Download the Tool**:\n   - Visit the official repository or website where HEPSYCODE is hosted (check references below for available links).\n   - Download the appropriate version for your system environment.\n\n2. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**:\n   - HEPSYCODE requires Java (version 8 or above).\n   - Visit the [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/) site to download and install Java.\n\n3. **Ensure Required Dependencies**:\n   - Supported platforms may include additional dependencies like Eclipse plugins for UML modeling.\n   - Download necessary UML modeling tools, such as Eclipse Papyrus.\n\n4. **HEPSYCODE Setup**:\n   - Extract the downloaded HEPSYCODE package into a folder.\n   - Run the setup script (usually setup.bat for Windows or setup.sh for Unix-based systems).\n   - Configure the tool through environmental variables as outlined in the README provided with the package.\n\n5. **Launch the Tool**:\n   - Open the HEPSYCODE executable or IDE plugin (if installed as part of Eclipse) to begin operation.\n\n6. **Optional**: If compatibility issues are encountered, refer to additional troubleshooting resources in the official documentation.\n\n## System Requirements\nThe following system specifications and dependencies are required to utilize HEPSYCODE:\n\n- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux.\n- **Software Dependencies**:\n  - Java SE Development Kit (version 8+).\n  - Eclipse IDE (recommended for UML modeling).\n  - Optional Integration: Papyrus or similar UML-based plugins for visual modeling.\n- **Hardware Requirements**:\n  - 4 GB RAM (minimum), 8 GB recommended.\n  - Processor: Multi-core with 64-bit architecture.\n  - Disk space: At least 500 MB for the tool, additional space for models and generated code.\n\n## Tutorial\nHere is a brief guide to using **HEPSYCODE** for developing a simple heterogeneous system:\n\n### Step 1: Define System Requirements\n- Start by identifying the system's functional and non-functional requirements. Determine which tasks will run on the software (e.g., algorithms) and which will utilize hardware (e.g., signal processing).\n\n### Step 2: Create System Models\n- Use UML diagrams to describe the architecture of your system.\n- You can model tasks, communication protocols, and interfaces. Ensure these models are saved in a compatible format recognizable by HEPSYCODE.\n\n### Step 3: Import into HEPSYCODE\n- Load the models into the HEPSYCODE workspace.\n- Run initial validations to ensure compatibility and correct parsing of UML models.\n\n### Step 4: Design Hardware-Software Mapping\n- Use HEPSYCODE's mapping tools to assign software components to hardware resources (e.g., CPU cores, GPUs, FPGAs).\n- Optimize the mapping for performance and resource utilization.\n\n### Step 5: Generate Code\n- Trigger the code generation process. HEPSYCODE will produce appropriate hardware descriptors (e.g., VHDL/Verilog) and equivalent software code (e.g., C/C++).\n\n### Step 6: Simulate and Validate\n- Use the inbuilt simulation tools to validate functionality and performance objectives.\n- Review logs and adjust system mappings or model inputs for improvements.\n\n### Step 7: Deploy to Target System\n- Using the generated codes, deploy the designs to your target embedded systems platform.\n\n### Advanced:\n- Explore the optimization modules to fine-tune the computational efficiency of the system.\n- Iterate between modeling, mapping, and validation for tackling more complex designs.\n\n## References\n- [HEPSYCODE Official Repository/Documentation](#) *(Placeholder for actual link)*  \n- Java JDK: [https://www.oracle.com/java/](https://www.oracle.com/java/)  \n- Eclipse IDE: [https://www.eclipse.org/](https://www.eclipse.org/)  \n- UML Papyrus Plugin: [https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/)  \n- General Documentation on Embedded System Co-Design: [https://dl.acm.org/](https://dl.acm.org/)"
