Overview\nHEPSYCODE (Hardware/Software co-design for Embedded Systems) is a specialized tool designed to facilitate the co-design and optimization of embedded systems. It provides a framework for modeling, analyzing, and synthesizing hardware and software components in a unified environment. The tool is particularly useful for system engineers and developers working on complex embedded systems, enabling them to achieve efficient hardware/software partitioning, scheduling, and performance optimization.\n\nHEPSYCODE adheres to the principles of model-driven engineering (MDE) and leverages the metamodel defined by the namespace `org.univaq.hepsy`. It is tailored to support the design of heterogeneous embedded systems, where both hardware and software components need to be seamlessly integrated to meet stringent performance and resource constraints.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Tool Name\n**HEPSYCODE**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Technical Details\nHEPSYCODE is built on the foundation of model-driven engineering (MDE) and employs a metamodel-based approach for system design. Key technical aspects include:\n\n- **Metamodeling**: HEPSYCODE uses the `org.univaq.hepsy` namespace to define the structure and semantics of the models it processes.\n- **Hardware/Software Partitioning**: The tool provides algorithms and methodologies for partitioning system functionality between hardware and software components.\n- **Scheduling**: HEPSYCODE includes scheduling techniques to optimize the execution of tasks across hardware and software platforms.\n- **Simulation and Analysis**: It supports simulation of the designed system to evaluate performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and resource utilization.\n- **Code Generation**: The tool can generate code for both hardware (e.g., VHDL, Verilog) and software (e.g., C/C++) components, ensuring compatibility with various embedded platforms.\n\nHEPSYCODE integrates with other tools and technologies commonly used in embedded system design, such as hardware description languages (HDLs), real-time operating systems (RTOS), and simulation frameworks.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Installation and Setup Instructions\nTo install and set up HEPSYCODE, follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Ensure that Java 8 or later is installed on your system.\n2. **Eclipse IDE**: HEPSYCODE is typically used as a plugin within the Eclipse IDE. Download and install Eclipse from [Eclipse Downloads](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).\n3. **Modeling Frameworks**: Install the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and other required plugins.\n\n### Installation Steps\n1. **Download HEPSYCODE**:\n   - Visit the official repository or website for HEPSYCODE and download the latest version of the tool.\n2. **Install the Plugin**:\n   - Open Eclipse IDE.\n   - Go to `Help > Install New Software`.\n   - Add the update site URL for HEPSYCODE (provided in the official documentation).\n   - Select the HEPSYCODE plugin and follow the installation wizard.\n3. **Restart Eclipse**:\n   - After installation, restart Eclipse to activate the plugin.\n\n### Configuration\n1. **Set Up Workspace**:\n   - Create a new workspace in Eclipse for your HEPSYCODE projects.\n2. **Import Metamodel**:\n   - Import the `org.univaq.hepsy` metamodel into your workspace.\n3. **Configure Dependencies**:\n   - Ensure all required libraries and dependencies are correctly configured in your project settings.\n\n---\n\n## 5. System Requirements\n### Hardware\n- **Processor**: Dual-core processor or higher.\n- **Memory**: Minimum 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended for large projects).\n- **Storage**: At least 500 MB of free disk space.\n\n### Software\n- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux.\n- **Java**: Java 8 or later.\n- **Eclipse IDE**: Version 2021-06 or later.\n- **Additional Plugins**: Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF), and other dependencies as specified in the documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Tutorial\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Using HEPSYCODE\n\n#### Step 1: Create a New Project\n1. Open Eclipse and select your workspace.\n2. Go to `File > New > Project`.\n3. Select `HEPSYCODE Project` from the list and click `Next`.\n4. Provide a name for your project and click `Finish`.\n\n#### Step 2: Define the System Model\n1. Open the `org.univaq.hepsy` metamodel in the model editor.\n2. Define the hardware and software components of your system.\n3. Specify the interactions and dependencies between components.\n\n#### Step 3: Perform Hardware/Software Partitioning\n1. Use the partitioning tool provided by HEPSYCODE to allocate system functionality to hardware and software.\n2. Adjust the partitioning based on performance and resource constraints.\n\n#### Step 4: Schedule Tasks\n1. Define the tasks and their execution order.\n2. Use the scheduling algorithms in HEPSYCODE to optimize task execution.\n\n#### Step 5: Simulate the System\n1. Run simulations to evaluate the performance of your design.\n2. Analyze the results and make adjustments as needed.\n\n#### Step 6: Generate Code\n1. Use the code generation feature to produce hardware and software code.\n2. Export the generated code to your target platform.\n\n#### Step 7: Deploy and Test\n1. Deploy the generated code to your embedded system.\n2. Test the system to ensure it meets the desired specifications.\n\n---\n\n## 7.
