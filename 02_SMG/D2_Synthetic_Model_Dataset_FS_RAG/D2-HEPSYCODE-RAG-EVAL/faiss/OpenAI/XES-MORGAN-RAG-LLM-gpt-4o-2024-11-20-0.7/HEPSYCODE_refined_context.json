Overview\nHEPSYCODE (Hardware/Software Evaluation and Partitioning System for Embedded Systems) is an advanced tool designed to assist in the design, evaluation, and partitioning of embedded systems. It provides an integrated environment for system engineers to model, simulate, and analyze embedded hardware/software systems, enabling efficient partitioning and optimization of tasks between hardware and software components. HEPSYCODE is particularly tailored for complex, real-time embedded systems, where achieving an optimal balance between hardware and software is critical for performance and cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe tool aligns with model-driven engineering (MDE) principles, employing high-level models to support decision-making during the early stages of design. By leveraging HEPSYCODE, developers can reduce development time, improve system performance, and ensure compliance with system requirements.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Tool Name\n**HEPSYCODE**  \nDerived directly from the package name provided in the metamodel: `HEPSYCODE`.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Technical Details\n- **Technology Stack**: HEPSYCODE leverages MDE methodologies, focusing on partitioning algorithms and simulation techniques. It supports system-level modeling languages such as UML (Unified Modeling Language) and MARTE (Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems).\n- **Methodologies**:\n  - **Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)**: Utilizes high-level abstractions to create system models.\n  - **Hardware/Software Co-Design**: Facilitates the joint design and optimization of hardware and software components.\n  - **Partitioning Algorithms**: Implements heuristic-based and constraint-driven partitioning algorithms to optimize task distribution.\n  - **Timing Analysis**: Provides tools for evaluating and ensuring timing constraints in real-time systems.\n- **Key Features**:\n  - Support for system-level modeling and simulation.\n  - Integration of performance evaluation tools.\n  - Automated and semi-automated partitioning capabilities.\n  - Compatibility with existing embedded system design workflows.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Installation and Setup Instructions\n\n### Prerequisites\nBefore installing HEPSYCODE, ensure the following prerequisites are met:\n- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Version 8 or later.\n- **Eclipse IDE**: Compatible with the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).\n- **Supported Modeling Tools**: UML and MARTE modeling tools such as Papyrus.\n\n### Installation Steps\n1. **Download HEPSYCODE**:\n   - Visit the official repository or website for HEPSYCODE to download the latest version (e.g., a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file containing the tool).\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**:\n   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK).\n   - Set up the Eclipse IDE with the necessary plugins for EMF and UML modeling.\n\n3. **Configure HEPSYCODE**:\n   - Extract the downloaded HEPSYCODE package.\n   - Import the HEPSYCODE project into Eclipse:\n     - Open Eclipse.\n     - Navigate to `File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace`.\n     - Select the directory containing the HEPSYCODE files.\n   - Install any required libraries or dependencies as prompted.\n\n4. **Verify Installation**:\n   - Launch the tool within Eclipse to verify the installation.\n   - Open a sample project or create a new model to ensure the environment is correctly set up.\n\n---\n\n## 5. System Requirements\n\n### Hardware\n- **Processor**: Multi-core processor (Intel i5 or equivalent, minimum).\n- **Memory**: At least 8 GB RAM (16 GB recommended for large projects).\n- **Disk Space**: 2 GB for installation, additional space for project files.\n\n### Software\n- **Operating System**:\n  - Windows 10 or later.\n  - Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 or later).\n  - macOS 10.15 or later.\n- **Java**: JDK 8 or higher.\n- **Eclipse IDE**: Version 2021-06 or newer.\n\n### Dependencies\n- Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).\n- UML modeling tools (e.g., Papyrus).\n- MARTE profile for real-time and embedded systems.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Tutorial\n\n### Step 1: Create a New Project\n1. Launch Eclipse and select the workspace.\n2. Go to `File > New > Project`.\n3. Select the HEPSYCODE project template or start with a UML-based project.\n\n### Step 2: Define the System Model\n1. Use UML diagrams to model the system architecture, including:\n   - Components (hardware/software).\n   - Communication interfaces.\n   - Timing constraints.\n2. Apply the MARTE profile to enhance the model with real-time and embedded system-specific annotations.\n\n### Step 3: Partition the System\n1. Use HEPSYCODE's partitioning tool to divide tasks between hardware and software components.\n2. Configure partitioning algorithms, setting constraints such as timing, cost, or power consumption.\n\n### Step 4: Perform Simulation\n1. Simulate the hardware/software interactions using the built-in simulation engine.\n2. Evaluate system performance, checking for bottlenecks or constraint violations.\n\n### Step 5: Optimize and Export\n1. Adjust the partitioning based on simulation results.\n2. Export the final design for implementation or further analysis.\n\n---\n\n## 7.
