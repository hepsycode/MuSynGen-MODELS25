    "context": "# 1. Overview\nHEPSYCODE (High Efficiency Parallel SYstems CODEsign) is a software tool aimed at supporting the design of parallel algorithms and architectures. It is developed through the HEPSYCODE research project conducted by the University of L'Aquila, under the namespace 'org.univaq.hepsy.' The main goal is to offer a solid environment for code designing, enabling a tailored balance between computation speed and energy efficiency. This makes it particularly suitable for high-performance computing applications, parallel and distributed systems, and dynamic reconfiguration architectures.\n\n# 2. Tool Name\nThe tool derived from the 'org.univaq.hepsy' package in the metamodel is named 'HEPSYCODE.'\n\n# 3. Technical Details\nHEPSYCODE is primarily developed in Java, making use of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) for model-driven engineering. Its architecture leverages the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, decoupling data handling, user interface, and system controls. The tool also integrates with various third-party libraries to enrich its feature set, including graph visualization libraries and algorithmic frameworks.\n\n# 4. Installation and Setup Instructions\nTo install and set up HEPSYCODE, carry out the following steps:\n\n1. **Download**: Visit the HEPSYCODE repository on the University of L'Aquila's project page. Download the latest release of the software.\n2. **Installation**: Unpack the downloaded file in your desired directory.\n3. **Setup**: Run the executable JAR file. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the setup, which includes setting the workspace and selecting active plugins.\n4. **Initialization**: Once the setup is complete, launch the HEPSYCODE tool.\n\n# 5. System Requirements\nHEPSYCODE can be run on any system possessing a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or higher. However, it is recommended to use a machine with at least a dual-core processor and 2GB of RAM for optimal performance. The tool supports all major operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.\n\n# 6. Tutorial\nA detailed user guide is provided in the 'Help' section of the tool. This guide walks users through the process of creating, managing, and analyzing designs. It also includes tutorials on the usage of various features and plugins packed with the HEPSYCODE tool.\n\n# 7.
