    "context": "# HEPSYCODE\n\n## Overview\n\nHEPSYCODE is a high-level software engineering tool that aids in the modeling and design of embedded systems. The name HEPSYCODE is derived directly from the package name in the metamodel. This tool is designed to streamline the process of creating efficient and optimized embedded systems by providing a robust and intuitive interface for system modeling and design. HEPSYCODE is based on the namespace URI: org.univaq.hepsy and does not use any specific classifiers.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nHEPSYCODE is developed in a modular way, where each module is designed to carry out specific tasks in the process of embedding systems design. It utilizes various technologies and methodologies to achieve its purpose. The primary language of development is Java, and it makes use of UML (Unified Modeling Language) for system modeling. Furthermore, the tool uses MDA (Model Driven Architecture) methodologies to provide a systematic approach to high-level system design and development.\n\n## Installation and Setup Instructions\n\n1. Download the latest version of the HEPSYCODE package from the official repository.\n2. Ensure that you have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system. If not, download and install the JRE from the official Oracle website.\n3. Extract the downloaded HEPSYCODE package to your desired location.\n4. Navigate to the extracted directory and run the installation script provided.\n5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.\n\n## System Requirements\n\nHEPSYCODE requires the following system specifications for optimal performance:\n\n- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux\n- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 or later\n- Minimum 2GB of RAM\n- At least 500MB of available disk space\n\n## Tutorial\n\nA comprehensive tutorial on how to use HEPSYCODE can be found in the official documentation provided with the tool. The tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to create and manipulate system models, use the MDA methodologies, and effectively design embedded systems using the tool.\n\n## References\n\nFor more detailed information on HEPSYCODE, refer to the official documentation included in the tool package. Additional resources can also be found at the official HEPSYCODE website at `www.hepsycode.org`.
