    "context": "# HEPSYCODE: A Comprehensive Overview\n\n## Overview\n\nHEPSYCODE (Hardware Embedded Parallel SYstems CODEsign) is a tool designed to aid in the development and design of embedded parallel systems. It provides an integrated environment for modeling, analysis, and synthesis of these systems. The tool is specifically designed to address the challenges of designing complex embedded systems that require high performance and low power consumption.\n\n## Tool Name\n\nThe tool is named HEPSYCODE, derived directly from the package name provided in the metamodel.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nHEPSYCODE is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), a modeling framework and code generation facility for building tools and other applications based on a structured data model. It uses the namespace URI: org.univaq.hepsy, as indicated in the metamodel.\n\nThe tool provides a graphical interface for system modeling, allowing users to design system architecture and specify system behavior. It also includes analysis tools for performance evaluation and power consumption estimation.\n\n## Installation and Setup Instructions\n\nTo install HEPSYCODE, follow these steps:\n\n1. Download the latest version of the tool from the official website.\n2. Extract the downloaded file to your preferred location.\n3. Run the executable file to start the installation process.\n4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\n\n## System Requirements\n\nHEPSYCODE requires the following system specifications:\n\n- Operating System: Windows 7 or higher, MacOS X, or Linux\n- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8 or higher\n- Eclipse Modeling Tools\n\n## Tutorial\n\nA step-by-step guide on how to use HEPSYCODE is available on the official website. The tutorial covers the following topics:\n\n1. Introduction to the tool and its interface.\n2. How to create a new project.\n3. How to design system architecture.\n4. How to specify system behavior.\n5. How to use the analysis tools.\n\n## References\n\nFor more information about HEPSYCODE, refer to the following sources:\n\n- [Official HEPSYCODE Website](http://www.hepsycode.com)\n- [HEPSYCODE User Guide](http://www.hepsycode.com/userguide)\n- [HEPSYCODE API Documentation](http://www.hepsycode.com/apidoc)\n- [Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) Documentation](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/docs/)"
