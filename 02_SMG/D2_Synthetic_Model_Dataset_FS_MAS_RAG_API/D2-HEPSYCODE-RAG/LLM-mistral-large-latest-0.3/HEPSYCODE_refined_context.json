    "context": "# Domain Overview\n\nThe Ecore metamodel provided defines a domain focused on the specification and behavior of systems, particularly those involving communication channels, nodes, and processes. This domain is reminiscent of hardware modeling, system behavior, and message passing in distributed systems. The metamodel is named \"hepsy\" and is part of the namespace \"org.univaq.hepsy\".\n\n# Key Concepts\n\n## Classes\n\n1. **BehaviorSpecification**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `nodes` (Type: Node, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n2. **Node** (Abstract)\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `nChannels` (Type: Channel, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n     - `ports` (Type: Port, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n3. **Channel**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `queueSize` (Type: EInt)\n     - `timeout` (Type: EInt)\n     - `rendezVous` (Type: EBoolean)\n     - `direction` (Type: EString)\n   - **References:**\n     - `nFrom` (Type: Node, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `nTo` (Type: Node, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `pFrom` (Type: Port, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `pTo` (Type: Port, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `message` (Type: Message, Containment: true)\n\n4. **NamedElement**\n   - **Supertype:** None\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `name` (Type: EString)\n   - **References:** None\n\n5. **StructuredNode**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `processes` (Type: Process, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n6. **Port**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `pChannels` (Type: Channel, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n     - `portExtension` (Type: Process)\n\n7. **Process**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `priority` (Type: EInt, Default Value: 1)\n     - `criticality` (Type: EInt)\n   - **References:**\n     - `processExtension` (Type: Port)\n\n8. **Display**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:** None\n\n9. **Stimulus**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:** None\n\n10. **Message**\n    - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n    - **Attributes:** None\n    - **References:**\n      - `entry` (Type: Entry, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n11. **Entry**\n    - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n    - **Attributes:**\n      - `type` (Type: EString, Lower Bound: 1)\n    - **References:** None\n\n## Enumerations\n\n1. **DataType**\n   - **Literals:** sc_bit, sc_logic, sc_int, sc_uint, sc_bigint, sc_biguint, sc_bv, sc_lv, sc_fixed, sc_ufixed, sc_fix, sc_ufix\n\n2. **Direction**\n   - **Literals:** Unidirectional, Bidirectional\n\n# Relationships\n\n1. **BehaviorSpecification** contains multiple **Node** instances.\n2. **Node** contains multiple **Channel** and **Port** instances.\n3. **Channel** can reference **Node** and **Port** instances for `nFrom`, `nTo`, `pFrom`, and `pTo`. It also contains a **Message**.\n4. **StructuredNode** contains multiple **Process** instances.\n5. **Port** contains multiple **Channel** instances and references a **Process**.\n6. **Process** references a **Port** and has attributes for `priority` and `criticality`.\n7. **Message** contains multiple **Entry** instances.\n8. **Entry** has a mandatory `type` attribute.\n\n# Behavioral Semantics\n\nThe metamodel implies a system where nodes communicate through channels, and these channels can have various properties like queue size, timeout, rendezvous, and direction. Nodes can be structured to contain processes, which have priorities and criticality levels. Ports act as interfaces for channels and can be extended by processes. Messages are composed of entries, each with a specific type.\n\n# External Domain Background\n\nThe domain represented by this metamodel is akin to hardware description languages (HDLs) and system-level design languages used in embedded systems and digital circuit design. Concepts like channels, nodes, ports, and processes are common in these domains, where communication and behavior specification are crucial.\n\n## Relevant Terminology\n\n- **Node:** A fundamental unit in the system, representing a component or module.\n- **Channel:** A communication pathway between nodes, with properties like queue size and timeout.\n- **Port:** An interface for channels, allowing nodes to send and receive messages.\n- **Process:** A unit of execution within a node, with attributes like priority and criticality.\n- **Message:** A data structure sent through channels, composed of entries.\n- **Entry:** A component of a message, with a specific data type.\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\n- **Hardware Modeling:** Describing the behavior and communication of hardware components.\n- **System Behavior:** Specifying the interaction and behavior of system components.\n- **Message Passing:** Defining how messages are sent and received between components.\n\n# Tool Context\n\n## Tool Name\n\nBased on the package name \"hepsy,\" the tool can be named \"HepsySys.\"\n\n## Tool Description\n\nHepsySys is a modeling tool designed for specifying the behavior and communication of systems, particularly in the domains of hardware modeling, system behavior, and message passing. It allows users to define nodes, channels, ports, processes, and messages, along with their attributes and relationships. The tool supports the creation of complex system models with detailed behavioral semantics, making it suitable for embedded systems and digital circuit design.\n\n## Tool Features\n\n- **Node Management:** Create and manage nodes, including structured nodes and processes.\n- **Channel Configuration:** Define channels with properties like queue size, timeout, rendezvous, and direction.\n- **Port Interfaces:** Specify ports as interfaces for channels and extend them with processes.\n- **Message Handling:** Construct messages with entries of various data types.\n- **Behavior Specification:** Model the behavior and communication of system components.\n\nThis structured context provides a comprehensive background for generating synthetic models based on the given Ecore metamodel, ensuring that the tool aligns with the domain's requirements and semantics."
