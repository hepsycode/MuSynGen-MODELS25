This domain is likely related to hardware modeling, system behavior, or message passing in distributed systems. The metamodel includes concepts such as `BehaviorSpecification`, `Node`, `Channel`, `Port`, and `Process`, which are commonly used in the design and analysis of complex systems.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Classes\n\n1. **BehaviorSpecification**\n   - **Supertype:** `NamedElement`\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `nodes` (Type: `Node`, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n2. **Node**\n   - **Supertype:** `NamedElement`\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `nChannels` (Type: `Channel`, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n     - `ports` (Type: `Port`, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n   - **Subtypes:** `StructuredNode`, `Process`, `Display`, `Stimulus`\n\n3. **Channel**\n   - **Supertype:** `NamedElement`\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `queueSize` (Type: `EInt`)\n     - `timeout` (Type: `EInt`)\n     - `rendezVous` (Type: `EBoolean`)\n     - `direction` (Type: `EString`)\n   - **References:**\n     - `nFrom` (Type: `Node`, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `nTo` (Type: `Node`, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `pFrom` (Type: `Port`, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `pTo` (Type: `Port`, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `message` (Type: `Message`, Containment: true)\n\n4. **NamedElement**\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `name` (Type: `EString`)\n\n5. **StructuredNode**\n   - **Supertype:** `Node`\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `processes` (Type: `Process`, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n6. **Port**\n   - **Supertype:** `NamedElement`\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `pChannels` (Type: `Channel`, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n     - `portExtension` (Type: `Process`)\n\n7. **Process**\n   - **Supertype:** `Node`\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `priority` (Type: `EInt`, Default Value: 1)\n     - `criticality` (Type: `EInt`)\n   - **References:**\n     - `processExtension` (Type: `Port`)\n\n8. **Display**\n   - **Supertype:** `Node`\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:** None\n\n9. **Stimulus**\n   - **Supertype:** `Node`\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:** None\n\n10. **Message**\n    - **Supertype:** `NamedElement`\n    - **Attributes:** None\n    - **References:**\n      - `entry` (Type: `Entry`, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n11. **Entry**\n    - **Supertype:** `NamedElement`\n    - **Attributes:**\n      - `type` (Type: `EString`, Lower Bound: 1)\n    - **References:** None\n\n### Enumerations\n\n1. **DataType**\n   - **Literals:** `sc_bit`, `sc_logic`, `sc_int`, `sc_uint`, `sc_bigint`, `sc_biguint`, `sc_bv`, `sc_lv`, `sc_fixed`, `sc_ufixed`, `sc_fix`, `sc_ufix`\n\n2. **Direction**\n   - **Literals:** `Unidirectional`, `Bidirectional`\n\n## Relationships\n\n### Containment Hierarchies\n- `BehaviorSpecification` contains multiple `Node` instances.\n- `Node` contains multiple `Channel` and `Port` instances.\n- `StructuredNode` contains multiple `Process` instances.\n- `Channel` contains a `Message`.\n- `Message` contains multiple `Entry` instances.\n- `Port` contains multiple `Channel` instances.\n\n### Associations\n- `Channel` can be associated with `Node` instances via `nFrom` and `nTo`.\n- `Channel` can be associated with `Port` instances via `pFrom` and `pTo`.\n- `Port` can be associated with a `Process` via `portExtension`.\n- `Process` can be associated with a `Port` via `processExtension`.\n\n### Multiplicities\n- Most references have an upper bound of -1, indicating they can contain multiple instances.\n- `Channel` references `nFrom`, `nTo`, `pFrom`, and `pTo` have a lower bound of 0, indicating they are optional.\n\n## Behavioral Semantics\nThe metamodel implies a system where nodes can communicate through channels, which can have properties like queue size, timeout, rendezvous, and direction. Processes within nodes can have priorities and criticality levels, indicating a system with real-time or critical system behavior. Ports can extend processes, suggesting a mechanism for process communication through ports and channels.\n\n## External Domain Background\nThe domain represented by the `hepsy` metamodel is likely related to hardware modeling, system behavior, or message passing in distributed systems. Concepts like `Node`, `Channel`, `Port`, and `Process` are common in these domains. The enumerations `DataType` and `Direction` suggest a focus on data types and communication directions, which are crucial in hardware and system design.\n\n### Relevant Terminology\n- **Node:** A fundamental unit in the system, representing a component or entity.\n- **Channel:** A communication path between nodes, with properties like queue size and timeout.\n- **Port:** An interface for communication, often associated with channels.\n- **Process:** An executable unit within a node, with attributes like priority and criticality.\n- **Message:** Data transferred between nodes via channels.\n- **Entry:** A component of a message, with a specific type.\n\n### Potential Applications\n- **Hardware Design:** Modeling interconnected hardware components.\n- **Distributed Systems:** Designing communication protocols and message passing mechanisms.\n- **Real-Time Systems:** Specifying processes with priorities and criticality levels.\n\n## Tool Name\nBased on the package name `hepsy`, the tool derived from this metamodel can be named \"HepsySys\".\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `hepsy` metamodel provides a comprehensive structure for modeling complex systems with interconnected nodes, channels, and processes. The domain context extracted from this metamodel can guide the generation of synthetic models for hardware design, distributed systems, and real-time systems. The tool \"HepsySys\" can leverage this context to facilitate the design and analysis of such systems."
