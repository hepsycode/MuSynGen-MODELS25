This metamodel is designed to support the specification and analysis of complex systems, likely in the domain of hardware modeling, system behavior, or message passing. The metamodel is encapsulated within the `hepsy` package, with the namespace URI `org.univaq.hepsy`.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Classes\n\n1. **BehaviorSpecification**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `nodes` (Type: Node, Multiplicity: 0..*, Containment: true)\n\n2. **Node** (Abstract)\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `nChannels` (Type: Channel, Multiplicity: 0..*, Containment: true)\n     - `ports` (Type: Port, Multiplicity: 0..*, Containment: true)\n\n3. **Channel**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `queueSize` (Type: EInt)\n     - `timeout` (Type: EInt)\n     - `rendezVous` (Type: EBoolean)\n     - `direction` (Type: EString)\n   - **References:**\n     - `nFrom` (Type: Node, Multiplicity: 0..1)\n     - `nTo` (Type: Node, Multiplicity: 0..1)\n     - `pFrom` (Type: Port, Multiplicity: 0..1)\n     - `pTo` (Type: Port, Multiplicity: 0..1)\n     - `message` (Type: Message, Containment: true)\n\n4. **NamedElement**\n   - **Supertype:** None\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `name` (Type: EString)\n   - **References:** None\n\n5. **StructuredNode**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `processes` (Type: Process, Multiplicity: 0..*, Containment: true)\n\n6. **Port**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `pChannels` (Type: Channel, Multiplicity: 0..*, Containment: true)\n     - `portExtension` (Type: Process)\n\n7. **Process**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `priority` (Type: EInt, Default: 1)\n     - `criticality` (Type: EInt)\n   - **References:**\n     - `processExtension` (Type: Port)\n\n8. **Display**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:** None\n\n9. **Stimulus**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:** None\n\n10. **Message**\n    - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n    - **Attributes:** None\n    - **References:**\n      - `entry` (Type: Entry, Multiplicity: 0..*, Containment: true)\n\n11. **Entry**\n    - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n    - **Attributes:**\n      - `type` (Type: EString, Multiplicity: 1)\n    - **References:** None\n\n### Enumerations\n\n1. **DataType**\n   - **Literals:**\n     - `sc_bit`\n     - `sc_logic`\n     - `sc_int`\n     - `sc_uint`\n     - `sc_bigint`\n     - `sc_biguint`\n     - `sc_bv`\n     - `sc_lv`\n     - `sc_fixed`\n     - `sc_ufixed`\n     - `sc_fix`\n     - `sc_ufix`\n\n2. **Direction**\n   - **Literals:**\n     - `Unidirectional`\n     - `Bidirectional`\n\n## Relationships\n\n- **BehaviorSpecification** contains multiple **Node** instances.\n- **Node** contains multiple **Channel** and **Port** instances.\n- **Channel** can reference **Node** and **Port** instances for `nFrom`, `nTo`, `pFrom`, and `pTo`.\n- **Channel** contains a **Message**.\n- **StructuredNode** contains multiple **Process** instances.\n- **Port** contains multiple **Channel** instances and references a **Process**.\n- **Process** references a **Port**.\n- **Message** contains multiple **Entry** instances.\n\n## Behavioral Semantics\n\nThe metamodel implies a hierarchical structure where `BehaviorSpecification` serves as the root element, containing various `Node` instances. Nodes can be specialized into `StructuredNode`, `Display`, `Stimulus`, and `Process`, each with specific attributes and references. Channels facilitate communication between nodes and ports, with attributes like `queueSize`, `timeout`, `rendezVous`, and `direction` defining communication properties. Messages and their entries are used to define the data exchanged through channels.\n\n## External Domain Background\n\n### Hardware Modeling and System Behavior\n\nThe Hepsy metamodel is reminiscent of hardware description languages (HDLs) and system behavior modeling frameworks. The concepts of nodes, channels, ports, and processes are commonly used in hardware design to describe components, their interconnections, and communication protocols. The inclusion of attributes like `queueSize`, `timeout`, and `rendezVous` suggests a focus on real-time systems and concurrent processes, where timing and synchronization are critical.\n\n### Message Passing\n\nThe metamodel's emphasis on channels and messages indicates a message-passing paradigm, commonly used in distributed systems and concurrent programming. Channels act as communication mediums between nodes and ports, with messages defining the data structure and content exchanged.\n\n### Real-Time Systems\n\nThe attributes `priority` and `criticality` in the `Process` class suggest a real-time systems context, where processes have different levels of importance and urgency. This is crucial in domains like embedded systems, where timely and predictable execution is essential.\n\n### Terminology\n\n- **Node:** A fundamental component in the system, representing a unit of behavior or structure.\n- **Channel:** A communication pathway between nodes and ports, with attributes defining its characteristics.\n- **Port:** An interface point for nodes, facilitating communication through channels.\n- **Process:** A specialized node representing a unit of execution with attributes like priority and criticality.\n- **Message:** The data structure exchanged through channels, containing entries that define the data types and values.\n\n## Tool Context\n\n### Tool Name\n\n**Hepsy Modeling Tool**\n\n### Tool Description\n\nThe Hepsy Modeling Tool is designed to support the creation, analysis, and simulation of behavior specifications in complex systems.
