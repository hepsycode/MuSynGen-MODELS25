This domain is likely related to hardware modeling, system behavior, or message-passing systems, where nodes represent entities that communicate through channels. The metamodel is part of the \"hepsy\" package, suggesting a tool named \"Hepsy\" for modeling and analyzing such systems.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Classes\n\n1. **BehaviorSpecification**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `nodes` (Type: Node, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n2. **Node** (Abstract)\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `nChannels` (Type: Channel, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n     - `ports` (Type: Port, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n3. **Channel**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `queueSize` (Type: EInt)\n     - `timeout` (Type: EInt)\n     - `rendezVous` (Type: EBoolean)\n     - `direction` (Type: EString)\n   - **References:**\n     - `nFrom` (Type: Node, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `nTo` (Type: Node, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `pFrom` (Type: Port, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `pTo` (Type: Port, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `message` (Type: Message, Containment: true)\n\n4. **NamedElement**\n   - **Supertype:** None\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `name` (Type: EString)\n   - **References:** None\n\n5. **StructuredNode**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `processes` (Type: Process, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n6. **Port**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `pChannels` (Type: Channel, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n     - `portExtension` (Type: Process)\n\n7. **Process**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `priority` (Type: EInt, Default Value: 1)\n     - `criticality` (Type: EInt)\n   - **References:**\n     - `processExtension` (Type: Port)\n\n8. **Display**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:** None\n\n9. **Stimulus**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:** None\n\n10. **Message**\n    - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n    - **Attributes:** None\n    - **References:**\n      - `entry` (Type: Entry, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n11. **Entry**\n    - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n    - **Attributes:**\n      - `type` (Type: EString, Lower Bound: 1)\n    - **References:** None\n\n### Enumerations\n\n1. **DataType**\n   - **Literals:** sc_bit, sc_logic, sc_int, sc_uint, sc_bigint, sc_biguint, sc_bv, sc_lv, sc_fixed, sc_ufixed, sc_fix, sc_ufix\n\n2. **Direction**\n   - **Literals:** Unidirectional, Bidirectional\n\n## Relationships\n\n- **BehaviorSpecification** contains multiple **Node** instances.\n- **Node** contains multiple **Channel** and **Port** instances.\n- **Channel** connects **Node** and **Port** instances, specifying communication properties such as `queueSize`, `timeout`, `rendezVous`, and `direction`.\n- **Channel** contains a **Message**.\n- **StructuredNode** contains multiple **Process** instances.\n- **Port** contains multiple **Channel** instances and can extend a **Process**.\n- **Process** can extend a **Port** and has attributes `priority` and `criticality`.\n- **Message** contains multiple **Entry** instances.\n- **Entry** has a `type` attribute.\n\n## Behavioral Semantics\n\n- **BehaviorSpecification** defines the overall behavior of the system by aggregating nodes.\n- **Node** represents an abstract entity that can have channels and ports.\n- **Channel** facilitates communication between nodes and ports, with properties defining the nature of the communication.\n- **Port** acts as an interface for communication, containing channels and potentially extending processes.\n- **Process** represents a computational entity with priority and criticality, extending ports.\n- **Message** encapsulates data transferred through channels, containing multiple entries.\n- **Entry** defines the type of data within a message.\n\n## External Domain Background\n\n### Hardware Modeling and System Behavior\n\nThe metamodel suggests a domain related to hardware modeling and system behavior, where nodes represent hardware components or system entities, and channels represent communication paths. The concepts of `priority` and `criticality` in processes indicate a focus on real-time systems, where timely and reliable communication is crucial.\n\n### Message Passing Systems\n\nThe inclusion of `Message` and `Entry` classes, along with `Channel` attributes like `queueSize` and `timeout`, aligns with message-passing systems. These systems require well-defined communication protocols and data structures to ensure efficient and reliable message exchange between nodes.\n\n### Real-Time Systems\n\nThe attributes `priority` and `criticality` in the `Process` class suggest that the domain involves real-time systems, where tasks have different levels of importance and urgency. The `rendezVous` attribute in `Channel` further supports this, indicating synchronous communication mechanisms typical in real-time systems.\n\n### Terminology\n\n- **Node:** A fundamental entity in the system, representing hardware components or system entities.\n- **Channel:** A communication path between nodes, defined by properties like `queueSize`, `timeout`, and `direction`.\n- **Port:** An interface for communication, containing channels and extending processes.\n- **Process:** A computational entity with attributes like `priority` and `criticality`.\n- **Message:** Data transferred through channels, containing multiple entries.\n- **Entry:** The type of data within a message.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe \"Hepsy\" metamodel defines a comprehensive structure for modeling and analyzing systems with nodes, channels, and messages. The domain context suggests applications in hardware modeling, system behavior, and real-time message-passing systems. The tool derived from this metamodel, named \"Hepsy,\" would facilitate the design and analysis of such systems, ensuring efficient and reliable communication between nodes."
