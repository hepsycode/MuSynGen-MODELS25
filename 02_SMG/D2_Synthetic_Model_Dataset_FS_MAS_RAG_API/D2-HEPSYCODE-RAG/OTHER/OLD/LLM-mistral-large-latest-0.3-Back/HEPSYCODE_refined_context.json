The metamodel is structured to represent nodes, channels, ports, processes, and messages, indicating a focus on communication and behavior within a system. The package name \"hepsy\" suggests that the tool might be named \"Hepsy Modeling Tool.\"\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Classes\n\n1. **BehaviorSpecification**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `nodes` (Type: Node, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n2. **Node** (Abstract)\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `nChannels` (Type: Channel, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n     - `ports` (Type: Port, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n3. **Channel**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `queueSize` (Type: EInt)\n     - `timeout` (Type: EInt)\n     - `rendezVous` (Type: EBoolean)\n     - `direction` (Type: EString)\n   - **References:**\n     - `nFrom` (Type: Node, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `nTo` (Type: Node, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `pFrom` (Type: Port, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `pTo` (Type: Port, Lower Bound: 0)\n     - `message` (Type: Message, Containment: true)\n\n4. **NamedElement**\n   - **Supertype:** None\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `name` (Type: EString)\n   - **References:** None\n\n5. **StructuredNode**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `processes` (Type: Process, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n6. **Port**\n   - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:**\n     - `pChannels` (Type: Channel, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n     - `portExtension` (Type: Process)\n\n7. **Process**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:**\n     - `priority` (Type: EInt, Default Value: 1)\n     - `criticality` (Type: EInt)\n   - **References:**\n     - `processExtension` (Type: Port)\n\n8. **Display**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:** None\n\n9. **Stimulus**\n   - **Supertype:** Node\n   - **Attributes:** None\n   - **References:** None\n\n10. **Message**\n    - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n    - **Attributes:** None\n    - **References:**\n      - `entry` (Type: Entry, Upper Bound: -1, Containment: true)\n\n11. **Entry**\n    - **Supertype:** NamedElement\n    - **Attributes:**\n      - `type` (Type: EString, Lower Bound: 1)\n    - **References:** None\n\n### Enumerations\n\n1. **DataType**\n   - **Literals:** sc_bit, sc_logic, sc_int, sc_uint, sc_bigint, sc_biguint, sc_bv, sc_lv, sc_fixed, sc_ufixed, sc_fix, sc_ufix\n\n2. **Direction**\n   - **Literals:** Unidirectional, Bidirectional\n\n## Relationships\n\n- **BehaviorSpecification** contains multiple **Nodes**.\n- **Node** contains multiple **Channels** and **Ports**.\n- **Channel** connects **Nodes** and **Ports**, and contains a **Message**.\n- **StructuredNode** contains multiple **Processes**.\n- **Port** contains multiple **Channels** and references a **Process**.\n- **Process** references a **Port**.\n- **Message** contains multiple **Entries**.\n\n## Behavioral Semantics\n\n- **BehaviorSpecification** aggregates nodes, which can be of various types such as **StructuredNode**, **Display**, **Stimulus**, and **Process**.\n- **Channels** facilitate communication between nodes and ports, with attributes like `queueSize`, `timeout`, `rendezVous`, and `direction` influencing the communication behavior.\n- **Processes** have attributes like `priority` and `criticality`, indicating their importance and urgency in the system.\n- **Messages** contain entries, which have a `type` attribute, suggesting that messages can carry different types of data.\n\n## External Domain Background\n\nThe metamodel suggests a domain focused on hardware or embedded systems design, where nodes represent different components, channels represent communication paths, and processes represent executable units within the system. The inclusion of attributes like `priority` and `criticality` in processes indicates a real-time or safety-critical system context.\n\n### Relevant Terminology\n\n- **Node:** A component within the system, which can be a structured node, display, stimulus, or process.\n- **Channel:** A communication path between nodes and ports, with properties like queue size, timeout, and direction.\n- **Port:** An interface for communication, which can be extended by processes.\n- **Process:** An executable unit within the system, with attributes like priority and criticality.\n- **Message:** A data structure containing entries, used for communication between nodes.\n- **Entry:** A data element within a message, with a specified type.\n\n### Real-World Application\n\nThe Hepsy Modeling Tool could be used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and industrial automation, where modeling and simulation of embedded systems are crucial for ensuring reliability and performance. The tool would allow engineers to design and analyze the behavior of complex systems, ensuring that communication between components is efficient and reliable.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Hepsy Modeling Tool, based on the provided Ecore metamodel, offers a comprehensive framework for modeling behavior specifications in hardware or embedded systems.
