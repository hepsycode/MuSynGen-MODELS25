    "context": "# Domain Overview\n\nThe \"hepsy\" metamodel appears to represent a domain focused on the modeling of system behaviors, particularly in the context of hardware or embedded systems. The metamodel is structured to define and manage the interactions between various components, such as nodes, channels, and processes, which are typical in system-level design and simulation environments. The presence of elements like channels, ports, and messages suggests a focus on communication and data flow within a system, which is crucial for modeling complex hardware systems.\n\n# Key Concepts\n\n## Classes\n\n1. **BehaviorSpecification**: This class serves as a container for nodes, indicating a specification of behavior within the system. It inherits from `NamedElement`, suggesting it has a unique identifier.\n\n2. **Node**: An abstract class representing a fundamental component in the system. Nodes can have channels (`nChannels`) and ports (`ports`), indicating their role in communication and data exchange.\n\n3. **Channel**: Represents a communication link between nodes. It includes attributes like `queueSize`, `timeout`, and `rendezVous`, which are critical for defining the behavior of data transmission. Channels connect nodes (`nFrom`, `nTo`) and ports (`pFrom`, `pTo`).\n\n4. **Port**: A point of interaction for nodes, allowing them to connect to channels. Ports can extend processes (`portExtension`), indicating a close relationship between data entry/exit points and process execution.\n\n5. **Process**: A specialized node that can execute tasks. It has attributes like `priority` and `criticality`, which are essential for scheduling and resource management in real-time systems.\n\n6. **StructuredNode**: A composite node that contains processes, indicating a hierarchical structure within the system.\n\n7. **Display** and **Stimulus**: Specialized nodes likely used for output and input operations, respectively.\n\n8. **Message**: Represents data being transmitted through channels. It contains entries (`entry`), which are likely data packets or units.\n\n9. **Entry**: A component of a message, characterized by a `type`, which is mandatory, indicating the data format or protocol.\n\n## Enumerations\n\n1. **DataType**: Enumerates various data types, such as `sc_bit`, `sc_logic`, and `sc_int`, which are common in hardware description languages like SystemC.\n\n2. **Direction**: Defines the directionality of communication, either `Unidirectional` or `Bidirectional`, which is crucial for understanding data flow constraints.\n\n# Relationships\n\n- **Containment**: `BehaviorSpecification` contains `Node` instances, `Node` contains `Channel` and `Port` instances, and `StructuredNode` contains `Process` instances. This hierarchical containment reflects the structural organization of a system.\n\n- **References**: Channels connect nodes and ports, indicating a network of communication paths. Ports and processes are interlinked, suggesting that processes can be extended or influenced by port interactions.\n\n- **Inheritance**: `Node` is a superclass for `Process`, `Display`, `Stimulus`, and `StructuredNode`, indicating these are specialized forms of nodes with additional capabilities or roles.\n\n# Behavioral Semantics\n\nThe metamodel implies a system where nodes communicate through channels, with ports serving as interfaces for data exchange. Processes within nodes execute tasks based on priority and criticality, which are essential for real-time operations. The attributes of channels, such as `queueSize` and `timeout`, suggest a focus on managing communication latency and data buffering, which are critical in hardware systems.\n\n# External Domain Background\n\nThe metamodel aligns with concepts from hardware description and system-level design, particularly in environments like SystemC or similar hardware modeling frameworks. The use of data types like `sc_int` and `sc_logic` further supports this alignment. The focus on communication, process execution, and hierarchical structuring is typical in the design of embedded systems, where components must interact efficiently and reliably.\n\n# Tool Context and Name Suggestion\n\nGiven the package name \"hepsy\" and the namespace URI \"org.univaq.hepsy\", an appropriate context for a tool utilizing this metamodel would be \"Hardware and Embedded System Process Specification\". A suitable name for the tool could be \"HepsyModeler\", reflecting its purpose in modeling and specifying the behavior of hardware and embedded systems."
