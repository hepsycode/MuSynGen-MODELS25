It is based on a System-Level methodology for HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated Systems. The whole framework drives the designer from an Electronic System-Level (ESL) behavioral model, with related NF requirements, including real-time and mixed-criticality ones, to the final HW/SW implementation, considering specific HW technologies, scheduling policies and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms. The system behavior modeling language introduced in HEPSYCODE, named HML (HEPSY Modeling Language), is based on the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) Model of Computation (MoC). It allows modeling the behavior of the system as a network of processes communicating through unidirectional synchronous channels. By means of HML it is possible to specify the System Behavior Model (SBM), an executable model of the system behavior, a set of Non Functional Constraints (NFC) and a set of Reference Inputs (RI) to be used for simulation-based activities. Through the execution of different steps, including a system-level Design Space Exploration (DSE) approach that allows the related co-design methodology to suggest an HW/SW partitioning of the application specification and a mapping of the partitioned entities onto an automatically defined heterogeneous multi-processor architecture, it is possible to proceed with system implementation.\\nHEPSYCODE uses Eclipse MDE technologies, SystemC custom simulator implementation and an evolutionary genetic algorithm for partitioning activities, all integrated into an automatic framework that drive the designer from first input to final solution.\\nThis repository contains the HEPSYCODE framework, which consists of a set of\\n\\nReference libraries\\nScripts and makefiles\\nEclipse plugins\\nXML data exchange files\\nSystemC files (part of the HEPSYM simulator)\\nHW/SW Partitioning And Mapping (PAM) tool\\n\\nWEBSITE\\nwww.HEPSYCODE.com\\nDOWNLOAD\\nOfficial git repository: https://github.com/HEPSYCODE/HEPSYCODE-AIDOaRt\\nINSTALLATION'), Document(metadata={'language': 'en-US', 'source': 'https://www.comp4drones.eu/hepsycode-electronic-system-level-hw-sw-co-design-of-heterogeneous-parallel-dedicated-systems/', 'title': 'HEPSYCODE: Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated Systems - ECSEL Comp4Drones'}, page_content='HEPSYCODE: Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated Systems - ECSEL Comp4Drones'), Document(metadata={'language': 'en-US', 'source': 'https://www.comp4drones.eu/hepsycode-electronic-system-level-hw-sw-co-design-of-heterogeneous-parallel-dedicated-systems/', 'title': 'HEPSYCODE: Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated Systems - ECSEL Comp4Drones'}, page_content='HEPSYCODE: Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated SystemsPosted on 5 years agoIn the last years, the spread and importance of embedded systems are even more increasing, but it is still not yet possible to completely engineer their system-level design flow. The main design problems are to model functional (F) and non-functional (NF) requirements and to validate the system before implementation. Designers commonly use one or more system-level models (e.g. block diagrams, UML, SystemC, etc.) to have a complete problem view and to perform a check on HW/SW resources allocation by simulating the system behavior. In this scenario, SW tools able to support designers to reduce cost and overall complexity of systems development are even more of fundamental importance. Co-existence of functional and non-functional requirements is the most relevant challenge. Unfortunately, there are no general methodologies defined for this purpose and, often, the only option is to refer to experienced designer indications with respect to empirical criteria and qualitative assessments. In such a context, this tutorial faces the problem of the HW/SW co-design of dedicated (possibly embedded and real-time) systems based on heterogeneous parallel architectures and presents the last advancements of a framework (with related methodology and prototypal tools), called HEPSYCODE (http://www.hepsycode.com/), able to support the development of such systems in different application domains. First of all, the tutorial presents the state of the art about the most used commercial and academic design tools in the field, with respect to methodology, design flow, system models and design space exploration (DSE) techniques.

It is based on a System-Level methodology for HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated Systems. The whole framework drives the designer from an Electronic System-Level (ESL) behavioral model, with related NF requirements, including real-time and mixed-criticality ones, to the final HW/SW implementation, considering specific HW technologies, scheduling policies and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms. The system behavior modeling language introduced in HEPSYCODE, named HML (HEPSY Modeling Language), is based on the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) Model of Computation (MoC). It allows modeling the behavior of the system as a network of processes communicating through unidirectional synchronous channels. By means of HML it is possible to specify the System Behavior Model (SBM), an executable model of the system behavior, a set of Non Functional Constraints (NFC) and a set of Reference Inputs (RI) to be used for simulation-based activities. Through the execution of different steps, including a system-level Design Space Exploration (DSE) approach that allows the related co-design methodology to suggest an HW/SW partitioning of the application specification and a mapping of the partitioned entities onto an automatically defined heterogeneous multi-processor architecture, it is possible to proceed with system implementation.\\nHEPSYCODE uses Eclipse MDE technologies, SystemC custom simulator implementation and an evolutionary genetic algorithm for partitioning activities, all integrated into an automatic framework that drive the designer from first input to final solution.\\nThis repository contains the HEPSYCODE framework, which consists of a set of\\n\\nReference libraries\\nScripts and makefiles\\nEclipse plugins\\nXML data exchange files\\nSystemC files (part of the HEPSYM simulator)\\nHW/SW Partitioning And Mapping (PAM) tool\\n\\nWEBSITE\\nwww.HEPSYCODE.com\\nDOWNLOAD\\nOfficial git repository: https://github.com/HEPSYCODE/HEPSYCODE-AIDOaRt\\nINSTALLATION'), Document(metadata={'language': 'en-US', 'source': 'https://www.comp4drones.eu/hepsycode-electronic-system-level-hw-sw-co-design-of-heterogeneous-parallel-dedicated-systems/', 'title': 'HEPSYCODE: Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated Systems - ECSEL Comp4Drones'}, page_content='HEPSYCODE: Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated Systems - ECSEL Comp4Drones'), Document(metadata={'language': 'en-US', 'source': 'https://www.comp4drones.eu/hepsycode-electronic-system-level-hw-sw-co-design-of-heterogeneous-parallel-dedicated-systems/', 'title': 'HEPSYCODE: Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated Systems - ECSEL Comp4Drones'}, page_content='HEPSYCODE: Electronic System-Level HW/SW Co-Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated SystemsPosted on 5 years agoIn the last years, the spread and importance of embedded systems are even more increasing, but it is still not yet possible to completely engineer their system-level design flow.

Designers commonly use one or more system-level models (e.g. block diagrams, UML, SystemC, etc.) to have a complete problem view and to perform a check on HW/SW resources allocation by simulating the system behavior.

      "- **Integration with Eclipse MDE Technologies**: The tool uses Eclipse Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) technologies, a SystemC custom simulator, and an evolutionary genetic algorithm for partitioning activities. These components are integrated into an automatic framework that guides the designer from initial input to the final solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Application and Use Cases\n",
      "\n",
      "HEPSYCODE is particularly useful in scenarios where embedded systems need to meet both functional and non-functional requirements, such as real-time and mixed-criticality constraints. The tool supports the development of systems across various application domains, providing a comprehensive view of the problem and enabling simulation-based validation of HW/SW resource allocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Research and Development\n",
      "\n",
      "The tool is part of the AIDOaRt European Project and has been discussed in various research publications. It is recognized for its ability to improve timing performance while reducing costs and energy consumption in embedded systems. The tool's development and application are documented in several academic articles, highlighting its role in advancing HW/SW co-design methodologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Resources and Further Reading\n",
      "\n",
      "- **GitHub Repository**: The HEPSYCODE framework, including reference libraries, scripts, Eclipse plugins, and SystemC files, is available on GitHub: [HEPSYCODE-AIDOaRt](https://github.com/hepsycode/HEPSYCODE-AIDOaRt).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Official Website**: Additional information and resources can be found on the official HEPSYCODE website: [www.HEPSYCODE.com](http://www.HEPSYCODE.com).\n",

      "question:  Electronic Design Automation for Embedded Systems using HEPSYCODE tool\n",
      "generation:  ### Electronic Design Automation for Embedded Systems using HEPSYCODE Tool\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Overview of HEPSYCODE\n",
      "\n",
      "HEPSYCODE (HW/SW CO-DEsign of HEterogeneous Parallel dedicated SYstems) is a prototypal tool designed to enhance the design process of embedded applications. It is particularly focused on the HW/SW co-design of heterogeneous parallel dedicated systems. The tool is part of a broader framework that supports the Electronic System-Level (ESL) design methodology, which is crucial for managing the complexities of modern embedded systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Features and Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "- **System-Level Design**: HEPSYCODE facilitates the transition from an ESL behavioral model to a final HW/SW implementation. This process considers specific hardware technologies, scheduling policies, and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Modeling Language**: The tool introduces the HEPSY Modeling Language (HML), which is based on the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) Model of Computation. HML allows for the modeling of system behavior as a network of processes communicating through unidirectional synchronous channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Design Space Exploration (DSE)**: A significant feature of HEPSYCODE is its system-level DSE approach. This methodology suggests an optimal HW/SW partitioning of the application specification and maps the partitioned entities onto a heterogeneous multi-processor architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Integration with Eclipse MDE Technologies**: The tool uses Eclipse Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) technologies, a SystemC custom simulator, and an evolutionary genetic algorithm for partitioning activities. These components are integrated into an automatic framework that guides the designer from initial input to the final solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Application and Use Cases\n",
      "\n",
      "HEPSYCODE is particularly useful in scenarios where embedded systems need to meet both functional and non-functional requirements, such as real-time and mixed-criticality constraints. The tool supports the development of systems across various application domains, providing a comprehensive view of the problem and enabling simulation-based validation of HW/SW resource allocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Research and Development\n",
      "\n",
      "The tool is part of the AIDOaRt European Project and has been discussed in various research publications. It is recognized for its ability to improve timing performance while reducing costs and energy consumption in embedded systems. The tool's development and application are documented in several academic articles, highlighting its role in advancing HW/SW co-design methodologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Resources and Further Reading\n",
      "\n",
      "- **GitHub Repository**: The HEPSYCODE framework, including reference libraries, scripts, Eclipse plugins, and SystemC files, is available on GitHub: [HEPSYCODE-AIDOaRt](https://github.com/hepsycode/HEPSYCODE-AIDOaRt).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Official Website**: Additional information and resources can be found on the official HEPSYCODE website: [www.HEPSYCODE.com](http://www.HEPSYCODE.com).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Research Publications**: For those interested in the academic aspects of HEPSYCODE, research publications are available at [Pomante's Publications](http://www.pomante.net/sito_gg/Publications.htm).\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, HEPSYCODE is a powerful tool for the electronic design automation of embedded systems, offering a robust framework for HW/SW co-design and system-level design space exploration. Its integration with modern technologies and methodologies makes it a valuable asset for designers aiming to optimize embedded system performance and efficiency.\n"
