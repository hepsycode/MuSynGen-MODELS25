Model the following business process for assessing credit risks:
When a new credit request is received, the risk is assessed. If the risk is above
a threshold, an advanced risk assessment needs to be carried out, otherwise a
simple risk assessment will suffice. Once the assessment has been completed, the
customer is notified with the result of the assessment, and in the meantime the
disbursement is organized.
For simplicity, you can assume that the result of an assessment is always positive.
Instructions: Only use the following BPMN elements: task, events, gateways, sequence
