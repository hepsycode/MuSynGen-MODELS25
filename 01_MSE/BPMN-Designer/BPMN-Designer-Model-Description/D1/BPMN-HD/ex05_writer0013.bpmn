Model the following business process for processing car damage claims:
The motor claim handling process starts when a customer submits a claim
with the relevant documentation. The notification department at the car insurer
checks the documents upon completeness and registers the claim. Next, the
Handling department picks up the claim and checks the insurance. Then, an
assessment is performed. If the assessment is positive, a garage is phoned to authorize
the repairs and the payment is scheduled (in this order). Otherwise, the
claim is rejected. The claim is also immediately rejected if any of the previous
checks fail. In any case (whether the outcome is positive or negative), a letter is
sent to the customer and the process is considered to be complete.
Instructions: Model the relevant resources (pools, lanes) and business objects (data
object, data store).
