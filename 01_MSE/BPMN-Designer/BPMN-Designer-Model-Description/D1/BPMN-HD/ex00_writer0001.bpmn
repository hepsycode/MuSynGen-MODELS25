Model the following business process for opening a bank account:
When the bank receives a new online application for opening a bank account, the
application is evaluated. If the application is rejected, the customer is notified by
email and the process ends. If the application is approved, a new bank account
is created. Before the process ends, the bank sends a welcome pack, a bank card,
and a PIN number in separate letters to the customer.
