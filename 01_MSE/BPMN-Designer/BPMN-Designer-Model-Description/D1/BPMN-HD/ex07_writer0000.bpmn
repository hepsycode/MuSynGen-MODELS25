Model the following business process for rating doctors in a hospital:
The doctor rating workflow at a hospital is carried out by two different roles.
The first one is a quality assurance (QA) specialist from the quality assurance
department, while the second one represents the managing director of the
hospital.

The QA specialist starts a new case regarding a certain doctor by interviewing
patients. Since a patient interview workflow is already established, it is simply
integrated in the new workflow. Meanwhile, the director asks an external expert
to review the work of the doctor under rating. Unfortunately, since the expert
only gets a low expenses fee, it can happen that the expert is not responding in
time. If that happens, another expert has to be asked (who could also not respond
in time, i.e. the procedure repeats). If an expert finally sends an expertise, it is
received by the director and forwarded to the QA specialist. The QA specialist
then files the results containing the patient interviews as well as the expertise and
afterwards creates a report. While the QA specialist is doing this, the manager
pays the expenses of the expert by filling a cheque and sending it to the expert.
Instructions: (1) Model the relevant resources (pools, lanes)
