Model the following business process between a supplier and a retailer:
After a retailer requests an offer from a supplier, the supplier prepares an offer
and sends it to the retailer. Next, the supplier can receive an order confirmation,
an order change, or an order cancellation from the retailer. It may happen that
no response is received at all. If no response is received after 48 hours, or if
an order cancellation is received, the supplier will cancel the order. If an order
confirmation is received within 48h, the supplier will process the order normally.
If an order change is received within 48h, the supplier will update the order and
ask again the retailer for confirmation. The retailer is allowed to change an
order at most three times. Afterwards, the supplier will automatically cancel the
order.
Instructions:

(2) Modeling the relevant business objects (data object, data store) is
not required.
