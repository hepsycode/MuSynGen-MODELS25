Model the following process which describes the selection and allocation of elective
courses at a school:
Version a):
Students must book two elective courses from the 5th school year onwards. Each
year ten teachers are responsible for offering elective courses (each teacher one
course). A course description is given by each teacher to the secretary’s office at
least one month before the start of the school year. The secretary collects all ten
descriptions and enters the information into the course booking system (CBS).
One week before the start of the school year, all responsible teachers receive a list
of students who have registered for their course from the secretary. The teachers
who have too many registered students choose which students can participate
in the course. As a general rule, students in a higher year have priority. The
(potentially empty) list of students who have not been accepted is handed over by
each teacher to the secretary’s office. The secretary then assigns these students
to courses in which there are still free places and rebooks the students in the
CBS.

Version b):
Students must book two elective courses from the 5th school year onwards. Each
year twelve teachers are responsible for offering elective courses (each teacher
one course). A course description is given by each teacher to the secretary’s office
at least two months before the start of the school year. The secretary collects
all twelve descriptions and enters the information into the course information
system (CIS). Two weeks before the start of the school year, all responsible
teachers receive a list of students who have registered for their course from the
secretary. The teachers who have too many registered students choose which
students can participate in the course. As a general rule, students in a lower
year have priority. The (potentially empty) list of students who have not been
accepted is handed over by each teacher to the secretary’s office. The secretary
then assigns these students to courses in which there are still free places and
rebooks the students in the CIS.
