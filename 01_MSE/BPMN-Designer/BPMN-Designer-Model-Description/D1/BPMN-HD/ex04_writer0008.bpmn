Model the following business process for damage compensation at rental properties:
If a tenant is evicted because of damages to the premises, a process needs to
be started by the tribunal in order to hold a hearing to assess the amount of
compensation the tenant owes to the owner of the premises. This process starts
when a cashier of the tribunal receives a request for compensation from the owner.
The cashier then retrieves the file for those particular premises and checks
that the request is both acceptable for filing and compliant with the description
of the premises on file. After these checks, the cashier needs to set a hearing
date. Setting a hearing date incurs fees to the owner. It may be that the owner
has already paid the fees with the request, in which case the cashier allocates a
hearing date and the process completes. If the owner has not paid the required
fees, the cashier produces a fees notice and waits for the owner to pay the fees
before reassessing the document compliance.
For simplicity, you can assume that the request always passes the checks.
