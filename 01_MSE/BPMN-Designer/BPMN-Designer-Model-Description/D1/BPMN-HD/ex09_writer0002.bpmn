Model the following business process which describes the admission process of
a PhD program at a university:
Version a):
To apply for the PhD program, students first fill in an online application form
with their personal data. Online applications are recorded in an admission information
system to which all staff members involved in the process have access.
After a student has submitted the online form, a PDF document is generated
and the student is requested to download it, sign it, and send it by post together
with a transcript of grades and a letter of motivation. When these documents
are received by the admissions office, the officer makes an initial assessment and
rejects the application if the student has insufficient grades (such notifications
of rejection are sent by email). In case of sufficient grades, the admissions office
forwards the student documents by internal mail to the academic committee,
which is responsible for deciding whether to offer admission or not. The committee
meets once every month to examine all applications that are ready for
academic assessment at the time of the meeting. At the end of the committee
meeting, the chair of the committee notifies the admissions office of the selection
outcomes. A few days later, the admissions office checks the selection outcomes
and sends a rejection or admission email to each candidate.
Version b):
To apply for the PhD program, students first fill in an online application form
with their personal data. Online applications are recorded in an application information
system to which all members involved in the process have access. After
a student has submitted the online form, a PDF document is generated and the
student is requested to download it, sign it, and send it by post together with
their diploma and a letter of motivation. When these documents are received by
the administration office, the officer makes an initial assessment and rejects the
application if the studentâ€™s motivation letter is not convincing (such notifications
of rejection are sent by letter). In case of a convincing letter of motivation,
the administration office forwards the student documents by internal mail to the
academic committee, which is responsible for deciding whether to offer admission
or not. The committee meets once every two months to examine all applications
that are ready for academic assessment at the time of the meeting. At the end
of the committee meeting, the committee notifies the administration office of the
outcomes. A few weeks later, the administration office checks the outcomes and
sends a rejection or admission letter to each candidate.
Instructions:
(1) Model the relevant resources (pools, lanes). The process should be modeled
from the university point of view, i.e. the student can be modeled as a black
box.
(2) Modeling business objects is not required.
