At the heart of the system is a central BehaviorSpecification that interconnects three key components: Stimulus, JPEG Reduced, and Display. The process begins with the Stimulus node, which produces raw image data through its output port named “stim_system_out_port.” This data is transmitted to the JPEG Reduced node via the “stim_acq_channel,” a dedicated communication link configured with a specific queue size and rendezvous semantics to ensure synchronized delivery.

Inside the JPEG Reduced node, the image compression pipeline is decomposed into several streamlined stages. The first process, “preproc,” receives the raw image data and performs essential pre-processing tasks—such as color space conversion and basic image scaling—and then forwards its output via the “preproc_dct_channel” to the next stage. The “DCT” process then applies the Discrete Cosine Transform to convert the spatial image data into frequency coefficients. The resulting coefficients are transmitted over the “dct_quant_channel” to the “quantization” process, which performs a simplified quantization using a basic quantization matrix. Next, the quantized coefficients are sent through the “quant_zigzag_channel” to the “zigzag” process, where they are reordered into a one-dimensional sequence following a reduced zigzag scanning pattern. Finally, the reordered data is passed via the “zigzag_entropy_channel” to the “entropy” process, where a reduced entropy encoding—such as a simplified Huffman coding—is applied to generate the final compressed bitstream.

The compressed output is then emitted from the JPEG Reduced node through the “system_display_out_port” and delivered to the Display node via the “jpeg_reduced_disp_channel,” connecting to the Display node’s input port “system_display_in_port.” Each channel and process is explicitly defined with dedicated message payloads and synchronization parameters, ensuring that data integrity, timing, and buffering requirements are rigorously maintained throughout the entire compression pipeline.
