The system is defined by a central BehaviorSpecification interconnecting three key components: Stimulus, FIRFIRGCD_ext, and Display. The process initiates at the Stimulus node, which produces raw digital signal data through its output port “stim_fir1_out_port.” This data is transmitted to the first FIR filter process, “fir1,” via the “stim_fir1_channel,” a dedicated link configured with a specific queue size and rendezvous semantics to ensure timely delivery. The “fir1” process applies its filtering algorithm to the incoming data and forwards the refined signal to the second FIR filter process, “fir2,” through the “fir1_fir2_channel.” The “fir2” process further processes the signal and then passes its output to an extension process, “fir_ext,” via the “fir2_firext_channel.” The “fir_ext” stage performs additional filtering or normalization to enhance the quality of the intermediate signal before it is delivered to the arithmetic unit. The enhanced signal is then transmitted to the GCD computation unit, “gcd,” through the “firext_gcd_channel.” Here, the “gcd” process computes the greatest common divisor of the processed data—serving as either a validation or normalization step—and encapsulates its result within a message payload (e.g., “gcd_display_payload”). Finally, this result is forwarded through the “gcd_display_channel” to the Display node’s input port “system_display_in_port,” where the final output is rendered. Each channel and process is explicitly defined with dedicated message payloads and synchronization parameters, ensuring that data integrity, timing, and buffering requirements are rigorously maintained across the entire processing pipeline.
