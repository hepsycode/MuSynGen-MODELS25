The system is defined by a central BehaviorSpecification that interconnects three key components: Stimulus, FIRFIRGCD_HPV, and Display. The process begins at the Stimulus node, which produces raw digital data through its output port named “stim_fir1_out_port.” This data is transmitted to the FIRFIRGCD_HPV node via the “stim_fir1_channel,” a dedicated communication link configured with a defined queue size and rendezvous semantics for synchronized data delivery. Inside the FIRFIRGCD_HPV node, the processing pipeline is organized into a series of sequential stages. First, the “fir1” process receives the raw data and applies an initial FIR filtering operation; its output is then forwarded through the “fir1_fir2_channel” to the second stage. The “fir2” process performs an additional FIR filtering step to further refine the signal. Following this, the filtered output is passed to the “hpv” process via the “fir2_hpv_channel.” The HPV module serves as an intermediate enhancement or verification stage, ensuring that the data meets the required quality standards before final processing. Its output is subsequently delivered to the “gcd” process through the “hpv_gcd_channel.” In this stage, the “gcd” process computes the greatest common divisor of the processed data, encapsulating its result in a message payload (for example, “gcd_display_payload”). Finally, the output from the GCD computation is transmitted from the FIRFIRGCD_HPV node through the “gcd_display_channel” to the Display node’s input port “system_display_in_port,” where the final result is rendered. Each channel and process is explicitly defined with precise message payloads and synchronization parameters, ensuring that data integrity, timing, and buffering constraints are rigorously maintained throughout the entire processing pipeline.
