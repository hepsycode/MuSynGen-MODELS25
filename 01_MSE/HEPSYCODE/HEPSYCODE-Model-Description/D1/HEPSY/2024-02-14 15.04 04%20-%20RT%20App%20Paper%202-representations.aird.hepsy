The RT App Paper 2 system is structured under a central BehaviorSpecification that interconnects three key components: Stimulus, RT App Paper 2, and Display. The process initiates at the Stimulus node, which continuously generates real-time data through its output port labeled “stim_rtPaper2_out_port.” This data is transmitted to the main processing unit via the “stim_rtPaper2_channel,” a dedicated link configured with a specific queue size and rendezvous semantics to guarantee synchronized delivery. Once inside the RT App Paper 2 node, the data enters a five-stage processing pipeline. The first stage is the “capture” process, which receives the input data via the “stim_capture_channel_2” and performs the initial data acquisition. The captured data is then forwarded to the “filter” process through the “capture_filter_channel_2,” where real-time filtering is applied to eliminate noise and enhance signal quality. Subsequently, the filtered data flows into the “preprocess” process via the “filter_preprocess_channel_2,” where further conditioning, such as normalization or scaling, is performed. The preprocessed data is then delivered to the “analyze” process through the “preprocess_analyze_channel_2,” where key features are extracted and real-time analysis is conducted to support decision-making. Finally, the analyzed information is passed to the “control” process via the “analyze_control_channel_2,” which generates the final command or processed output. This output is emitted from the RT App Paper 2 node through the “system_display_out_port” and is conveyed to the Display node via the “disp_rtPaper2_channel,” connecting to the Display node’s input port “system_display_in_port.” Every channel is explicitly defined with dedicated message payloads and synchronization parameters, ensuring that data integrity, timing, and buffering requirements are rigorously maintained across the entire processing pipeline.
