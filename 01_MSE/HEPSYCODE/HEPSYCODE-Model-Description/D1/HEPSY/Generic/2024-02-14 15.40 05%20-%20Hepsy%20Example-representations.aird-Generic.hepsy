The Hepsy Example model is a demonstrative embedded application developed for electronic design automation. It is structured around three primary nodes: a Stimulus node that generates raw input data, a main application node that processes the data through a series of integrated processes, and a Display node that renders the final output. Communication between these nodes is realized through a network of typed ports and channels, ensuring proper synchronization, buffering, and real-time data flow. Overall, the model serves as a blueprint for designing embedded systems where input acquisition, data processing, and output display are clearly delineated and interconnected.
