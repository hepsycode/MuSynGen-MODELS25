The SUSAN model represents an embedded image processing application designed to implement the SUSAN algorithm for edge and feature detection. The architecture is structured around three primary nodes: a Stimulus node that acquires raw image data, a main SUSAN node where the algorithm is executed through a series of dedicated processing stages, and a Display node that renders the final processed image. Communication among these nodes is managed through clearly defined ports and channels, ensuring synchronized data transfer and proper buffering. The design embodies a modular and scalable approach suitable for high-performance embedded systems within the electronic design automation domain.
