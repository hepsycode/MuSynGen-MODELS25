The Roberts model represents an embedded application designed to perform edge detection using the Roberts operator. It is structured around three main nodes: a Stimulus node that generates raw image data, a central Roberts node that processes the image through a series of dedicated processes implementing the Roberts filter, and a Display node that renders the final edge-detected output. Communication among these nodes is managed via a network of typed ports and channels, ensuring proper synchronization, buffering, and real-time data transfer throughout the system.
