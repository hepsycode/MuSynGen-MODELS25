The model represents a digital camera system designed within an embedded application framework for electronic design automation. It features three principal nodes: a Stimulus node that generates raw image data, a main application node that processes the data through eight parallelized codec processes, and a Display node that renders the final image. Communication between these nodes is established via a network of typed ports and channels, ensuring proper data synchronization and buffering. The overall architecture is modular, with the eight parallel processes in the main application orchestrating tasks ranging from initial pre-processing to advanced codec operations, thereby enabling high throughput and real-time performance.
