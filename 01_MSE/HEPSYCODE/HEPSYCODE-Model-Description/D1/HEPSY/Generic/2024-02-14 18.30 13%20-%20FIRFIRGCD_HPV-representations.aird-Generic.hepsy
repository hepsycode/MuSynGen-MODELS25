The FIRFIRGCD_HPV model represents an advanced embedded signal processing application within the electronic design automation domain. It extends the conventional FIRFIRGCD architecture by incorporating an additional HPV stage, designed to enhance or verify the processed signal before final arithmetic operations. The system is structured around three primary nodes: a Stimulus node that generates raw digital data, a central processing node (FIRFIRGCD_HPV) that executes a multi-stage pipeline including two cascaded FIR filters, an HPV module, and a GCD computation unit, and a Display node that renders the final output. Communication among these nodes is achieved via a network of typed ports and channels, ensuring robust synchronization, proper buffering, and real-time performance.
