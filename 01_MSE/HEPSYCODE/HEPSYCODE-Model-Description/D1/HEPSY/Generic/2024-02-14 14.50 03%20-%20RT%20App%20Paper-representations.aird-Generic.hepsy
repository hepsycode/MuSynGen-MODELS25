The RT App Paper model is a real-time embedded application designed for high-performance signal processing within the electronic design automation framework. Its architecture comprises three key nodes: a Stimulus node that continuously generates real-time input data, an RT App Paper node that implements the core processing through a series of integrated processes, and a Display node that renders the final output. Communication among these nodes is managed via a network of typed ports and channels that ensure precise synchronization and buffering. Overall, the design supports stringent real-time requirements while being structured to facilitate both simulation and eventual synthesis into hardware/software platforms.
