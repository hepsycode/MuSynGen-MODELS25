The RT App Paper 2 model represents a real-time embedded application tailored for high-performance signal processing within the electronic design automation domain. It is architected around three primary nodesâ€”a Stimulus node that continuously supplies real-time input data, a central RT App Paper 2 node that processes this data through a multi-stage pipeline, and a Display node that presents the final output. The processing node is designed with a series of integrated processes that collectively handle data capture, filtering, preprocessing, analysis, and control. Communication among these nodes is managed via a network of typed ports and channels that ensure robust synchronization, appropriate buffering, and timely data transfer, meeting the stringent demands of real-time applications.
