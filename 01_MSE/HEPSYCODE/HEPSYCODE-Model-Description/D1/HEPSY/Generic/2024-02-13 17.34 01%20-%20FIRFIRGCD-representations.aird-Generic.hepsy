The RT App model represents a real-time embedded application designed within the electronic design automation framework. It is structured around three primary nodes: a Stimulus node that generates continuous real-time input data, a main application node (RTApp) that processes the data through multiple sequential and concurrent processes, and a Display node that renders the final output. Communication between these nodes is established via a network of typed ports and channels, which ensure accurate synchronization, buffering, and timely data delivery. Overall, the architecture is modular and is intended to support rigorous real-time performance analysis and synthesis.
