The RASTA-PLP model represents an embedded application designed for robust speech processing using the RASTA-PLP algorithm. It is structured around three primary nodes: a Stimulus node that generates raw audio input, a central RastaPlp node that processes the signal through multiple algorithmic stages, and a Display node that renders the final filtered output. Communication among these nodes is handled via a network of typed ports and channels that ensure proper synchronization and real-time data transfer. Overall, the model embodies a modular architecture where the main application node integrates sequential processing stages to extract robust perceptual features from the speech signal.
