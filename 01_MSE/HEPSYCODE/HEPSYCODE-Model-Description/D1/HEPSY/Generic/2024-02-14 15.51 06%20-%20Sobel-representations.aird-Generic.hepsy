The Sobel model represents an embedded application designed to perform edge detection using the Sobel filter algorithm. It is organized around three main nodes: a Stimulus node that generates raw image data, a central Sobel processing node that implements the filter through a series of interconnected processes, and a Display node that renders the final edge-detected image. Communication between these nodes is achieved via a network of typed ports and channels, ensuring proper synchronization, buffering, and real-time data handling. Overall, the architecture is modular and tailored for efficient embedded image processing in the electronic design automation domain.
