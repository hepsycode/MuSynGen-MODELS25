The JPEG Encoder model represents an embedded application designed for image compression using the JPEG standard. It is structured around three primary nodes: a Stimulus node that acquires raw image data, a main JPEG Encoder node that executes the various stages of the JPEG algorithm, and a Display node that presents the final compressed output. Communication among these nodes is managed through a network of typed ports and channels, ensuring proper synchronization, buffering, and real-time performance. Overall, the architecture is modular and scalable, making it well-suited for implementation in electronic design automation workflows and embedded systems.
