The FIRFIRGCD_ext model represents an advanced embedded signal processing application within the electronic design automation domain. This extended version builds on a classic pipeline by incorporating an additional processing stage for enhanced signal refinement. The architecture is organized around three primary nodes: a Stimulus node that generates raw digital data, a main processing node that executes a series of filtering and arithmetic operations across four sequential processes, and a Display node that renders the final output. Communication among these nodes is managed via a network of typed ports and channels, ensuring precise synchronization, buffering, and data integrity throughout the pipeline.
