The JPEG Reduced model represents an embedded application that implements a streamlined version of the JPEG image compression algorithm. It is organized around three primary nodes: a Stimulus node that acquires raw image data, a central JPEG Reduced node that processes the data through a series of simplified compression stages, and a Display node that presents the final compressed output. Communication among these nodes is managed through a network of typed ports and channels that ensure proper synchronization and buffering. The overall design achieves a balance between compression efficiency and reduced computational complexity, making it well-suited for resource-constrained embedded systems in the electronic design automation domain.
