At the heart of the system is a central BehaviorSpecification that interconnects three key components: Stimulus, JPEG Encoder, and Display. The process begins with the Stimulus node, which produces raw image data via its output port “stim_system_out_port.” This raw data is transmitted to the JPEG Encoder node through the “stim_acq_channel,” a dedicated communication link configured with a specific queue size and rendezvous semantics for synchronized delivery.

Within the JPEG Encoder node, the image compression pipeline is decomposed into several sequential processing stages. The first stage is the “preproc” process, which receives the raw image data and performs initial conditioning tasks such as color space conversion and image scaling; its output is sent via the “preproc_dct_channel” to the next stage. In the subsequent “DCT” process, the Discrete Cosine Transform is applied to convert spatial image data into frequency coefficients, and the results are forwarded through the “dct_quant_channel” to the “quantization” process. Here, the quantization stage reduces the precision of the DCT coefficients based on a predefined quantization matrix, effectively compressing the data. The quantized coefficients are then transmitted over the “quant_zigzag_channel” to the “zigzag” process, which reorders them into a one-dimensional sequence following the JPEG zigzag pattern to group low-frequency coefficients efficiently. Finally, the reordered data enters the “entropy” process via the “zigzag_entropy_channel,” where Huffman encoding is applied for entropy encoding, producing the final compressed bitstream.

The compressed data is then output from the JPEG Encoder node through the “system_display_out_port” and is delivered to the Display node via the “jpeg_disp_channel,” connecting to the Display node’s input port “system_display_in_port.” Each channel and process is explicitly defined with dedicated message payloads and synchronization parameters, ensuring that data integrity, timing, and buffering requirements are rigorously maintained throughout the entire compression pipeline.
